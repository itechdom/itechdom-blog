### Tables

- In Turing, we have teachers, students, courses, classes. They are the "things" that are in our database.

- We define these in what we call Tables. And they look like tables you see in any application (word, excel .. etc)

- Each table has rows, and columns

- Columns give properties to our data or table: name, age, gender, race ... etc

- Rows are entries in our table: Sam, Rebecca, John etc

|  Name       |     Age   | Gender
|:-------------|------------- :| ------------- :|
|  Sam        |     25    | Male |
|  Rebecca    |     21    | Female |
