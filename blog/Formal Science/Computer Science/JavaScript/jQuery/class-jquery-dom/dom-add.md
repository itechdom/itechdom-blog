### Adding to the DOM

Let's take a look at four approaches of adding/changing content in the DOM.

* `.text()`
* `.html()`
* `.append()`
* `.appendTo()`


### Dead Presidents

* Find all of the presidents who died in office (hint: they have a `died` class on their `tr`).
* Append `<span class="died">(Died)<span>` to the the `term` column.
