# Features
<div>SEAMLESS JAVA INTEROP<br></div><div>Scala runs on the JVM, so Java and Scala stacks can be freely mixed for totally seamless integration.</div><div><br></div><div>TYPE INFERENCE</div><div>So the type system doesn&#x2019;t feel so static. Don&#x2019;t work for the type system. Let the type system work for you!</div><div><br></div><div>CONCURRENCY</div><div>&amp; DISTRIBUTION</div><div>Use data-parallel operations on collections, use actors for concurrency and distribution, or futures for asynchronous programming.</div><div><br></div><div>TRAITS</div><div>Combine the flexibility of Java-style interfaces with the power of classes. Think principled multiple-inheritance.</div><div><br></div><div>PATTERN MATCHING</div><div>Think &#x201C;switch&#x201D; on steroids. Match against class hierarchies, sequences, and more.</div><div><br></div><div>HIGHER-ORDER FUNCTIONS</div><div>Functions are first-class objects. Compose them with guaranteed type safety. Use them anywhere, pass them to anything.</div>
