You must read piapro character guidline/license
when you use Vocaloid(Miku, Meiko, etc.) related stuffs (including MMD models)
and must know what you're allowed/unallowed to do with them.

And also you must know that MMD model/motion/audio use is very restricted.
You're required to read each MMD model/motion/audio data readme/guideline/license
when you use it.

Generally the followings are NOT allowed
- file redistribution
- porn use
- commercial use
- etc.

If you want to use the model/motion/audio data for them,
you must look for the data which the author EXPLICITLY allows for them.

DON'T judge as it's allowed if it isn't mentioned.
