## Angular way

What we had to do in the previous example:

- create list element in code and insert them
- update display everytime we make a change
- We are not focusing on the data in our application (task list)


## Angular Way

- We can re-write our previous application in a couple of lines in Angualrjs.
- We will review all the steps that we take into converting the TODO list app into an Angularjs app.
