### Constraints

- Sometimes we want to define some rules on our tables that restricts certain entries

- Three types of constraints: column, data type, custom

- Examples:

    * name should be 20 characters long
    * age should be between 18 - 80


## in SQL

- we first start by creating a Database. A database is a container for our data. Let's call it Turing.

in SQL

```html

CREATE DATABASE Turing

```
