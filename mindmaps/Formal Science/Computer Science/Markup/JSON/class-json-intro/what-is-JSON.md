### What is JSON?

* JSON stands for "JavaScript Object Notation"
* It's a subset of the object syntax in JavaScript. All JSON is valid JavaScript, but not all JavaScript objects are valid JSON (functions, non-string keys, etc.)
* It maps easily onto the data structures used by most programming languages (numbers, strings, booleans, nulls, arrays and hashes/dictionaries)
* It looks and acts similarly like Ruby's hash syntax
* It's lightweight and easy for humans to read and write
* Most programming languages have a library for reading and writing JSON structures

**tl;dr**: JSON strikes a balance between being human readable and machine readable.

JSON is commonly used by APIs to send data back and forth when you don't need/want to render a full web page.
