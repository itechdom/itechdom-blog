## Rough Definition
<h2 class="articlePageTitle">Defining the Quantum Computer</h2><p>The Turing machine, developed by&#xA0;<strong>Alan Turing</strong>&#xA0;in the 1930s, is a theoretical device that consists of tape of unlimited length that is divided into little squares. Each square can either hold a symbol (1 or 0) or be left blank. A read-write device reads these symbols and blanks, which gives the machine its instructions to perform a certain program. Does this sound familiar? Well, in a&#xA0;<strong>quantum</strong>&#xA0;Turing machine, the difference is that the tape exists in a quantum state, as does the read-write head. This means that the symbols on the tape can be either 0 or 1 or a&#xA0;<strong>superposition</strong>&#xA0;of 0 and 1; in other words the symbols are both 0 and 1 (and all points in between) at the same time. While a normal Turing machine can only perform one calculation at a time, a quantum Turing machine can perform many calculations at once.</p>
