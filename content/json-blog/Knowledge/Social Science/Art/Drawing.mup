Then you decide all the details and then you basically make the details happen. The flaw in that approach is that you’re limited by your initial idea. The most interesting idea that you had is what you’re going to end up making, and probably less than that because games are hard to make so you end up not being able to do everything that you wanted.</p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin-bottom: 0.9rem; padding: 0px; font-size: 0.9rem; line-height: 1.5; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">With (“Braid” and “The Witness”), what I did was a little bit different.

I just looked at what happened with that subject matter and started playing with it. … Sometimes that will make the game become something a little bit different than that initial idea I had, but it always becomes better and more interesting than the original idea.
