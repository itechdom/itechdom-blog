Each square can either hold a symbol (1 or 0) or be left blank. A read-write device reads these symbols and blanks, which gives the machine its instructions to perform a certain program. Does this sound familiar? Well, in a&nbsp;<strong style=\"font-style: inherit;\">quantum</strong>&nbsp;Turing machine, the difference is that the tape exists in a quantum state, as does the read-write head. This means that the symbols on the tape can be either 0 or 1 or a&nbsp;<strong style=\"font-style: inherit;\">superposition</strong>&nbsp;of 0 and 1; in other words the symbols are both 0 and 1 (and all points in between) at the same time. While a normal Turing machine can only perform one calculation at a time, a quantum Turing machine can perform many calculations at once.</p>","key":1,"id":414,"level":0}}}]
