Your account statement describes the method that applies to you. In general, your balance for Interest Charges is based on one of these methods:</p><br><ul><p><strong>Average Daily Balance:</strong>&#xA0;<br>The card company adds the amount you still owe from your previous statement (if you didn&#x2019;t pay in full) to all new purchases and cash advances, and then divides the sum by the number of days in the billing cycle. It is shown on your statement each month you use the card.</p><p><strong>Adjusted Balance:</strong>&#xA0;<br>The card company takes your balance at the beginning of the Billing Cycle. It subtracts payments you make during the period. This means your balance is kept lower and you pay less in Interest Charges.</p><p><strong>Previous Balance:</strong>&#xA0;<br>This method applies the monthly Interest Charge to your beginning balance for the Billing Cycle. Purchases and payments during the month that follow aren&#x2019;t included.</p><p><strong>Ending Balance:</strong>&#xA0;<br>The card company may use your ending balance for the Billing Cycle. If so, any purchases and payments during the Billing Cycle are included.</p></ul>"},{"indent":3,"title":"Nice Example of interest charges"},{"indent":3,"content":"<p>An Example: Discovering the Benefit of Increasing Your Payments<br>Let\\&apos;s say John and Jane both have $2,000 debt on their credit cards, which require a minimum payment of 3%, or $10, whichever is higher. Both are strapped for cash, but Jane manages to pay an extra $10 on top of her minimum monthly payments. John pays only the minimum.</p><p>Each month John and Jane are charged a 20% annual interest on their cards\\&apos; outstanding balances. So, when John and Jane make payments, part of those payments go to paying interest and part go to the&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/principal.asp\" target=\"_blank\">principal</a>.</p><p>Here is the breakdown of the numbers for the first month of John\\&apos;s credit card debt:</p><ul><li>Principal: $2,000</li><li>Interest: $33.33 ($2,000 x (20%/12))</li><li>Payment: $60 (3% of remaining balance)</li><li>Principal Repayment (payment - interest<span>): $26.67</span></li><li>Remaining Balance: $1,973.33 ($2,000 - $26.67)</li></ul><p>These calculations are done every month until the credit card debt is paid off.</p><p>In the end, John pays $4,240 in total over 15 years to absolve the $2,000 in credit card debt.

Paying twice your minimum or more can drastically cut down the time it takes to pay off the balance, which leads to lower interest charges.<br>However, as we will see below, it\\&apos;s wise not to pay only your minimum or even just a little more than your minimum. It\\&apos;s best simply not to carry a balance at all.</p><span><br><br>Read more:&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/articles/01/061301.asp#ixzz3kVHvPTm0\" target=\"_blank\">Understanding Credit Card Interest</a>&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/articles/01/061301.asp#ixzz3kVHvPTm0\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.investopedia.com/articles/01/061301.asp#ixzz3kVHvPTm0</a>&#xA0;<br>Follow us:&#xA0;<a href=\"http://ec.tynt.com/b/rf?id=arwjQmCEqr4l6Cadbi-bnq&amp;u=Investopedia\" target=\"_blank\">Investopedia on Facebook</a></span>"},{"indent":2,"title":"Terms"},{"indent":3,"title":"Billing Cycle"},{"indent":3,"title":"Statement"},{"indent":3,"title":"Cash Advances"},{"indent":4,"title":"https://www.citicards.com/cards/wv/html/cm/student/credit-card-abcs/how-credit-cards-work/cash-advances.html"},{"indent":3,"title":"Principle"},{"indent":3,"title":"Interest"},{"indent":2,"title":"Pain Points"},{"indent":3,"title":"How do I now which type of interest charges is applied?"},{"indent":2,"title":"Fees may be Associated"},{"indent":2,"content":"<p><strong>Other costs of credit</strong><br>There are other fees and expenses associated with using credit cards.
