Increased computing power has also led to the growing popularity of computationally intensive methods based on [resampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resampling_(statistics) "Resampling (statistics)"), such as permutation tests and the [bootstrap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_(statistics) "Bootstrapping (statistics)"), while techniques such as [Gibbs sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbs_sampling "Gibbs sampling") have made use of Bayesian models more feasible. The computer revolution has implications for the future of statistics with new emphasis on "experimental" and "empirical" statistics. A large number of both general and special purpose [statistical software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_statistical_packages "List of statistical packages") are now available.The rapid and sustained increases in computing power starting from the second half of the 20th century have had a substantial impact on the practice of statistical science. Early statistical models were almost always from the class of [linear models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_model "Linear model"), but powerful computers, coupled with suitable numerical [algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms "Algorithms"), caused an increased interest in [nonlinear models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_regression "Nonlinear regression") (such as [neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_networks "Neural networks")) as well as the creation of new types, such as[generalized linear models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_linear_model "Generalized linear model") and [multilevel models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilevel_model "Multilevel model").

### How can it be used?
## What are NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, ...?[](https://www.scipy.org/getting-started.html#what-are-numpy-scipy-matplotlib "Permalink to this headline")

SciPy and friends can be used for a variety of tasks:

*   _NumPy_‘s array type augments the Python language with an efficient data structure useful for numerical work, e.g., manipulating matrices._NumPy_ also provides basic numerical routines, such as tools for finding eigenvectors.
*   _SciPy_ contains additional routines needed in scientific work: for example, routines for computing integrals numerically, solving differential equations, optimization, and sparse matrices.
*   The [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/) module produces high quality plots. With it you can turn your data or your models into figures for presentations or articles. No need to do the numerical work in one program, save the data, and plot it with another program.
*   Using [IPython](http://ipython.org/) makes interactive work easy. Data processing, exploration of numerical models, trying out operations on-the-fly allows to go quickly from an idea to a result. See the [IPython site](http://ipython.org/) for many examples.
*   There is a sizeable collection of both generic and application-specific numerical and scientific code, written using Python, NumPy and SciPy. Don’t reinvent the wheel, there may already be a pre-made solution for your problem. See [_Topical Software_](https://www.scipy.org/topical-software.html) for a partial list.
*   As Python is a popular general-purpose programming language, it has many advanced modules for building for example interactive applications (see e.g. [wxPython](http://www.wxpython.org/) and [Traits](http://code.enthought.com/projects/traits/)) or web sites (see e.g. [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)). Using SciPy with these is a quick way to build a fully-fledged scientific application.
