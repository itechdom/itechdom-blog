# Intro
### What's JavaScript
>   
> 



1.  

    We saw before how we used html and css to display things on the browser

    

the browser essentially reads the html and css and figure out how to display them

  


  


example:

  




p{

font-size:80px

}



  


 hello world

  


with Javascript: we telling the browser to do more things than just display this text or any other html elements:

  


things like: go to javascript and where to find it

  


JavaScript is a programming language with syntax. just like a real language.

2.  

    

    

    a programming language commonly used to create interactive websites. Using HTML and CSS only is very limited in their own way. You can use HTML and CSS to achieve a lot of things, but unfortunately this falls short in many Cases. This is when JavaScript comes in handy.

    

    

    

  



### What does Javascript Do and Where do you find it?
_You find it in many places:_



_Slide show images, _

_clicking on something and doing something,_

_Creating online games,_

_creating Mobile apps (New)_

_this slide show is created by JavaScript_


### How is JavaScript written: in Statements 
we load javascript same way we load css files. 

The browser reads the script file line by line. these are essentially instructions. If it succeeds, the browser will show no error. If it fails we can examine the error in the console

How does the browser read those statments: Sequantially, line by line.

The rules for valid format and combinations of instructions is called a _computer language_, sometimes referred to as its_syntax_, much the same as English tells you how to spell words and how to create valid sentences using words and punctuation.  


  


as you go, you will be able to gather different concepts into a knowledge

  


  














I write very, very detailed instructions for a very, very dumb machine












### Write gibberish statement and see if the browser shows an error
For accessing the command line. type CMD+SHIFT+ the letter i

# Core
### Variables and Box Analogy
Variable Name: Box Label

Inside the box is the value

values can be either a number or a string. A String is called that because it's a string of chars.

Example: 

var a = 2

----------------

          2           

----------------

if you want to get what's inside the box "a"

you just do this:

a ! that simple
### Data Types
String, Number For now
### Store variables and display them
Write a program that will create different variables and use Alert to display those values
### Number (Math) Expressions and String Expressions
Don't be alarmed, this is just  


+ - * /

String Expressions is just adding Strings together. This is when the difference between a text and a number comes in. If you add two strings together you join them.
### life time supply example
Reference an HTML element and then apply a style
### If statments and logic
Comparisions and Logic

Write it out as words first the convert it to JavaScript untill you get used to it

If bananas are greater than 5 then display the result

if bananas > 5 {



> alert "you need more bananas"



}

else (any other case){

alert "you have enough bananas"

}
### Check the supply of Bananas and display something
### Functions
Functions are like recepies that are repeated in your application. When you make hard boiled eggs what do you do? this could be like a function? a list of instructions that we store in a recepie that yield some result

this is how we tell the browser to store it:

for example function a ( )

take a value

multiply it with 2

return the value to whoever called it

ingridents are the variables we pass to the function 

the food that's made is what the function returns

list of examples

sometimes we buy food that's already made so we don't have to make anything.

sometimes you call function without knowing what they contain, which is something we do all the time in programming

think of functions as factories that have a collection of statments

it could take a box and modify it then return a new box

It's like a belt, on one end there's processing, on the other there's a box

Some factories don't accept boxes, they produce them.

you can package it as you like

Example

var a = "hello"

alert "hello"

Instead of writing this every time, we can store it in a box (variable) and retrieve it late

by doing this

function BoxLabel ( ){

var a = "help"

alert a

}

BoxLabel ( )

How do I make functions even more powerfull, make them a little more useful, abstract, lets say you want to add two numbers together and you want the user to supply the numbers and you get the results

this is usefull, because it make it easy to call that box and make it easier for people to reuse it for any two numbers.

  
Example:

function addTwoNumbers(a,b){

return a+b

}

results =  addTwoNumbers(1,2)

alert results
### Store the functions to calculate the bananas to make your program simpler
### Global Scope and Function Scope
whatever boxes we have in the factory (function), we can't access outside of it.

function {

a = 2  


}
### Loops
sometimes we need to repeat statements instead of copying and pasting them 

so if I wanted to write hello 20 times, I would do something like this

log hello

log hello

log hello

what if we 
### Arrays
Numbered Shelfs and contains boxes 0,1,2,3,4 ... etc
### Objects
think of objects as any entity that has properties, a person is an object, a car is an object. Anything that you can describe could be an object.

This how we create objects in JS

{

name: "hello"

age: 21

}

We move to a more complex example here, we have a box and inside of that box is a Person! WHAAAT?!!!!

Each person has name, age
### Array Of Objects
Box with people on Shelves
### DOM
*   Show the DOM
*   Explain that it's composed of objects
*   Explain what interactions is made to manipulate the DOM
*   DOM is just a list of elements connected together they call it a tree. Where there are children and parents [insert DOM picture here]
### TODO list
### ES6
# Thrid Party
### jQuery
jQuery is a library, think of a library as a collection of factories (functions) that produce certain results. You have to learn how to use the library: to reduce time, follow best practices that other people wrote.

jQuery has a special syntax the dollar sign, that makes it extremely easy to do DOM manipulation, binding events, create image sliders, 

Learning jQuery will save you time and effort in writing a lot of code to manipulate DOM. Although there are new libraries coming up, It's used heavily by web developers. 
### API
Is a way to access data in other web systems. Meetup website for example. The web is full of apis that you can leverage:

Facebook

twitter

google

foursquare

etc
### jQuery and Ajax
jQuery has a function called ajax that we call to request data from meetup. Let's see how we do that

$.ajax

{

}
