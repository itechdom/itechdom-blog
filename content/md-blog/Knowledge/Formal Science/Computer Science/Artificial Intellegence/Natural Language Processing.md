### Corpus
The machine-learning paradigm calls instead for using general learning algorithms — often, although not always, grounded in [statistical inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_inference "Statistical inference") — to automatically learn such rules through the analysis of large _[corpora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_corpus "Text corpus")_ of typical real-world examples. A _corpus_(plural, "corpora") is a set of documents (or sometimes, individual sentences) that have been hand-annotated with the correct values to be learned.
