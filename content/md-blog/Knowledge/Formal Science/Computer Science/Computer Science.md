### Activities
Architecture activities[edit]There are many activities that a software architect performs. A software architect typically works with project managers, discusses architecturally significant requirements with stakeholders, designs a software architecture, evaluates a design, communicates with designers and stakeholders, documents the architectural design and more.[22] There are four core activities in software architecture design.[23] These core architecture activities are performed iteratively and at different stages of the initial software development life-cycle, as well as over the evolution of a system.Architectural Analysis is the process of understanding the environment in which a proposed system or systems will operate and determining the requirements for the system. The input or requirements to the analysis activity can come from any number of stakeholders and include items such as:what the system will do when operational (the functional requirements)how well the system will perform runtime non-functional requirements such as reliability, operability, performance efficiency, security, compatibility defined in ISO/IEC 25010:2011 standard [24]development-time non-functional requirements such as maintainability and transferability defined in ISO 25010:2011 standard [24]business requirements and environmental contexts of a system that may change over time, such as legal, social, financial, competitive, and technology concerns [25]Architectural Synthesis or design is the process of creating an architecture. Given the architecturally significant requirements determined by the analysis, the current state of the design and the results of any evaluation activities, the design is created and improved. See [3]:pp.311–326[23] for a discussion of various techniques for improving a current design.Architecture Evaluation is the process of determining how well the current design or a portion of it satisfies the requirements derived during analysis. An evaluation can occur whenever an architect is considering a design decision, it can occur after some portion of the design has been completed, it can occur after the final design has been completed or it can occur after the system has been constructed. Some of the available software architecture evaluation techniques include Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method (ATAM) and TARA.[26] Frameworks for comparing the techniques are discussed in frameworks such as SARA Report [15] and Architecture reviews: practice and experience.[27]Architecture Evolution is the process of maintaining and adapting an existing software architecture to meet requirement and environmental changes. As software architecture provides a fundamental structure of a software system, its evolution and maintenance would necessarily impact its fundamental structure. As such, architecture evolution is concerned with adding new functionality as well as maintaining existing functionality and system behaviour.Architecture requires critical supporting activities. These supporting activities take place throughout the core software architecture process. They include knowledge management and communication, design reasoning and decision making, and documentation.
### Styles and Patterns
Architectural styles and patterns[edit]Main article: Software Architecture styles and patternsAn architectural pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software architecture within a given context. Architectural patterns are often documented as software design patterns.Following traditional building architecture, a 'software architectural style' is a specific method of construction, characterized by the features that make it notable" (Architectural style). "An architectural style defines: a family of systems in terms of a pattern of structural organization; a vocabulary of components and connectors, with constraints on how they can be combined."[31]"Architectural styles are reusable 'packages' of design decisions and constraints that are applied to an architecture to induce chosen desirable qualities."[32]There are many recognized architectural patterns and styles, among them:BlackboardClient-server (2-tier, 3-tier, n-tier, cloud computing exhibit this style)Component-basedData-centricEvent-driven (or Implicit invocation)Layered (or Multilayered architecture)Monolithic applicationPeer-to-peer (P2P)Pipes and filtersPlug-insRepresentational state transfer (REST)Rule-basedService-orientedMicroservices architectureShared nothing architectureSpace-based architectureSome treat architectural patterns and architectural styles as the same,[33] some treat styles as specializations of patterns. What they have in common is both patterns and styles are idioms for architects to use, they "provide a common language"[33] or "vocabulary"[31] with which to describe classes of systems.

### Reflection
Reflection (computer programming)From Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaIn computer science, reflection is the ability of a computer program to examine (see type introspection) and modify its own structure and behavior (specifically the values, meta-data, properties and functions) at runtime.[1]
### Ability of a program to change its behavior on run time
### Example
Examples[edit]The following code snippets create an instance foo of class Foo, and invoke its method hello. For each programming language, normal and reflection-based call sequences are shown.ECMAScript[edit]The following is an example in ECMAScript, and therefore also applies to JavaScript and ActionScript:// Without reflection new Foo.hello() // With reflection // assuming that Foo resides in this new this['Foo']['hello']() // or without assumption new (eval('Foo'))['hello']() // or simply eval('new Foo.hello()')
### + agile
Software architecture and agile development[edit]Main article: Agile developmentThere are also concerns that software architecture leads to too much Big Design Up Front, especially among proponents of Agile software development. A number of methods have been developed to balance the trade-offs of up-front design and agility,[34] including the agile method DSDM which mandates a "Foundations" phase during which "just enough" architectural foundations are laid. IEEE Software devoted a special issue[35] to the interaction between agility and architecture.
