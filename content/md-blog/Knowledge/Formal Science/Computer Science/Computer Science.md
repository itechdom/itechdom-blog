### Computational NueroScience

### Studies the actual Nuerons in terms of their biological structure and simulate them
### Different from computational Learning theory 
### Software packages simulating Nerves

### It's somewhat puzzling how neurons can be uniform while being sparse. Artificial neural networks don't possess such quality
### Challenges
### Overhead in computation, efforts have been done to come up with faster algorithms
