### Vulnerabilities
## Vulnerabilities[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Computer_security&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Vulnerabilities")]

Main article: [Vulnerability (computing)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability_(computing) "Vulnerability (computing)")

A vulnerability is a system susceptibility or flaw, and an _exploitable_ vulnerability is one for which at least one working attack exists. Many vulnerabilities are documented in the [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures "Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures") (CVE) database and vulnerability management is the cyclical practice of identifying, classifying, remediating, and mitigating vulnerabilities.

To understand the techniques for securing a computer system, it is important to first understand the various types of "attacks" that can be made against it, and these [threats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threat_(computer) "Threat (computer)") can typically be classified into one of the categories in the sections below:

### Backdoors[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Computer_security&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Backdoors")]

A [backdoor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backdoor_(computing) "Backdoor (computing)") in a computer system, a [cryptosystem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptosystem "Cryptosystem") or an algorithm, is any secret method of bypassing normal authentication or security controls.

### Denial-of-service attack[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Computer_security&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Denial-of-service attack")]

Main article: [Denial-of-service attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack "Denial-of-service attack")

Denial of service attacks are designed to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users. Attackers can deny service to individual victims, such as by deliberately entering a wrong password enough consecutive times to cause the victim account to be locked, or they may overload the capabilities of a machine or network and block all users at once.

An attack from a single IP address can be blocked by adding a new firewall rule, but many forms of [Distributed denial of service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_denial_of_service#Distributed_attack "Distributed denial of service") (DDoS) attacks are possible, where the attack comes from a large number of points - and defending is much more difficult. Such attacks can originate from the [zombie computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie_computer "Zombie computer") of a [botnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botnet "Botnet"), but a range of other techniques are possible including [reflection and amplification attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack#Reflected_.2F_spoofed_attack "Denial-of-service attack"), where innocent systems are fooled into sending traffic to the victim.

### Direct-access attacks[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Computer_security&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Direct-access attacks")]



[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/PersonalStorageDevices.agr.jpg/220px-PersonalStorageDevices.agr.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:PersonalStorageDevices.agr.jpg)



[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:PersonalStorageDevices.agr.jpg "Enlarge")

Common consumer devices that can be used to transfer data surreptitiously.





An unauthorized user gaining physical access to a computer is often able to compromise security by making [operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system "Operating system") modifications, installing software [worms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_worm "Computer worm"), [keyloggers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystroke_logging "Keystroke logging"), or [covert listening devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covert_listening_device "Covert listening device"). They may be able to easily download data. Even when the system is protected by standard security measures, these may be able to be by passed by booting another operating system or tool from a [CD-ROM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD-ROM "CD-ROM") or other bootable media. [Disk encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_encryption "Disk encryption") and [Trusted Platform Module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_Platform_Module "Trusted Platform Module") are designed to prevent these attacks.

### Eavesdropping[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Computer_security&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Eavesdropping")]

Eavesdropping is the act of surreptitiously listening to a private conversation, typically between hosts on a network. For instance, programs such as [Carnivore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnivore_(FBI) "Carnivore (FBI)") and [NarusInsight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narus_(company) "Narus (company)") have been used by the [FBI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation "Federal Bureau of Investigation") and [NSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Agency "National Security Agency") to eavesdrop on the systems of [internet service providers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_service_provider "Internet service provider"). Even machines that operate as a closed system (i.e., with no contact to the outside world) can be eavesdropped upon via monitoring the faint [electro-magnetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism "Electromagnetism")transmissions generated by the hardware; [TEMPEST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TEMPEST "TEMPEST") is a specification by the NSA referring to these attacks.

### Spoofing[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Computer_security&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Spoofing")]

[Spoofing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoofing_attack "Spoofing attack") of user identity describes a situation in which one person or program successfully masquerades as another by falsifying data.

### Tampering[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Computer_security&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Tampering")]

[Tampering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampering_(crime) "Tampering (crime)") describes a malicious modification of products. So-called ["Evil Maid" attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rootkit#bootkit "Rootkit") and security services planting of surveillance capability into routers[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security#cite_note-3) are examples.

### Repudiation[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Computer_security&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Repudiation")]

[Repudiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-repudiation "Non-repudiation") describes a situation where the [authenticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication "Authentication") of a signature is being challenged.

### Information disclosure[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Computer_security&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Information disclosure")]

Information disclosure ([privacy breach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_privacy "Data privacy") or [data leak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_leak "Data leak")) describes a situation where information, thought to be secure, is released in an untrusted environment.

### Privilege escalation[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Computer_security&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Privilege escalation")]

[Privilege escalation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privilege_escalation "Privilege escalation") describes a situation where an attacker gains elevated privileges or access to resources that were once restricted to them.

### Exploits[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Computer_security&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Exploits")]

Main article: [Exploit (computer security)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploit_(computer_security) "Exploit (computer security)")

An exploit is a software tool designed to take advantage of a flaw in a computer system. This frequently includes gaining control of a computer system, allowing [privilege escalation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privilege_escalation "Privilege escalation"), or creating a denial of service attack. The code from exploits is frequently reused in[trojan horses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_horse_(computing) "Trojan horse (computing)") and [computer viruses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_virus "Computer virus"). In some cases, a vulnerability can lie in certain programs' processing of a specific file type, such as a non-executable media file. Some security web sites maintain lists of currently known unpatched vulnerabilities found in common programs.

### Social engineering and trojans[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Computer_security&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Social engineering and trojans")]

Main article: [Social engineering (security)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_(security) "Social engineering (security)")

See also: [Category:Cryptographic attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Cryptographic_attacks "Category:Cryptographic attacks")

[social engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_(computer_security) "Social engineering (computer security)") aims to convince a user to disclose secrets such as passwords, card numbers, etc. by, for example, impersonating a bank, a contractor, or a customer.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security#cite_note-4)

### Indirect attacks[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Computer_security&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Indirect attacks")]

An indirect attack is an attack launched by a third-party computer. By using someone else's computer to launch an attack, it becomes far more difficult to track down the actual attacker. There have also been cases where attackers took advantage of public anonymizing systems, such as the [Tor onion router](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(anonymity_network) "Tor (anonymity network)") system.

### Computer crime[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Computer_security&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Computer crime")]

[Computer crime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_crime "Computer crime") refers to any crime that involves a computer and a [network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network "Computer network").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security#cite_note-moore-5)
### Security Emergency Teams
## National teams[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Computer_security&action=edit&section=63 "Edit section: National teams")]

Here are the main [computer emergency response teams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_emergency_response_team "Computer emergency response team") around the world. Every country have their own team to protect network security. February 27, 2014, the Chinese network security and information technology leadership team is established. The leadership team will focus on national security and long-term development, co-ordination of major issues related to network security and information technology economic, political, cultural, social, and military and other fields of research to develop network security and information technology strategy, planning and major macroeconomic policy promote national network security and information technology law, and constantly enhance security capabilities.

### Europe[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Computer_security&action=edit&section=64 "Edit section: Europe")]

CSIRTs in Europe collaborate in the [TERENA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TERENA "TERENA") task force TF-CSIRT. [TERENA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TERENA "TERENA")'s Trusted Introducer service provides an accreditation and certification scheme for CSIRTs in Europe. A full list of known CSIRTs in Europe is available from the Trusted Introducer website.

This section **may require [cleanup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Cleanup "Wikipedia:Cleanup") to meet Wikipedia's [quality standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style "Wikipedia:Manual of Style")**. No [cleanup reason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Cleanup/doc "Template:Cleanup/doc") has been specified. Please help [improve this section](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Computer_security&action=edit) if you can. _(November 2010)_







The following terms used with regards to engineering secure systems are explained below.

*   Access [authorization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorization "Authorization") restricts access to a computer to group of users through the use of [authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication "Authentication") systems. These systems can protect either the whole computer – such as through an interactive [login](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Login "Login") screen – or individual services, such as an [FTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol "File Transfer Protocol") server. There are many methods for identifying and authenticating users, such as [passwords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password "Password"), [identification cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identification_card "Identification card"), and, more recently, [smart cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_card "Smart card") and [biometric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biometric "Biometric") systems.
*   [Anti-virus software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-virus_software "Anti-virus software") consists of computer programs that attempt to identify, thwart and eliminate [computer viruses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_viruses "Computer viruses") and other malicious software ([malware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware "Malware")).
*   [Applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software "Application software") with known security flaws should not be run. Either leave it turned off until it can be patched or otherwise fixed, or delete it and replace it with some other application. Publicly known flaws are the main entry used by [worms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_worm "Computer worm") to automatically break into a system and then spread to other systems connected to it. The security website [Secunia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Secunia&action=edit&redlink=1 "Secunia (page does not exist)") provides a search tool for unpatched known flaws in popular products.
*   [Authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication "Authentication") techniques can be used to ensure that communication end-points are who they say they are.
*   [Automated theorem proving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_theorem_proving "Automated theorem proving") and other verification tools can enable critical algorithms and code used in secure systems to be mathematically proven to meet their specifications.
*   [Backups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backup "Backup") are a way of securing information; they are another copy of all the important computer files kept in another location. These files are kept on hard disks, [CD-Rs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD-R "CD-R"), [CD-RWs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD-RW "CD-RW"), [tapes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_tape_data_storage "Magnetic tape data storage") and more recently on the cloud. Suggested locations for backups are a fireproof, waterproof, and heat proof safe, or in a separate, offsite location than that in which the original files are contained. Some individuals and companies also keep their backups in [safe deposit boxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe_deposit_box "Safe deposit box") inside [bank vaults](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_vault "Bank vault"). There is also a fourth option, which involves using one of the [file hosting services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_hosting_service "File hosting service") that backs up files over the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet "Internet") for both business and individuals, known as the cloud.
    *   Backups are also important for reasons other than security. Natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, or tornadoes, may strike the building where the computer is located. The building can be on fire, or an explosion may occur. There needs to be a recent backup at an alternate secure location, in case of such kind of disaster. Further, it is recommended that the alternate location be placed where the same disaster would not affect both locations. Examples of alternate disaster recovery sites being compromised by the same disaster that affected the primary site include having had a primary site in [World Trade Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Center_(1973-2001) "World Trade Center (1973-2001)") I and the recovery site in [7 World Trade Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_World_Trade_Center "7 World Trade Center"), both of which were destroyed in the [9/11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9/11 "9/11") attack, and having one's primary site and recovery site in the same coastal region, which leads to both being vulnerable to hurricane damage (for example, primary site in New Orleans and recovery site in [Jefferson Parish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_Parish "Jefferson Parish"), both of which were hit by [Hurricane Katrina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina "Hurricane Katrina") in 2005). The backup media should be moved between the geographic sites in a secure manner, in order to prevent them from being stolen.
*   [Capability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability_(computers) "Capability (computers)") and [access control list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_control_list "Access control list") techniques can be used to ensure privilege separation and mandatory access control. [This section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security#Capabilities_vs._ACLs "Computer security") discusses their use.
*   [Chain of trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_of_trust "Chain of trust") techniques can be used to attempt to ensure that all software loaded has been certified as authentic by the system's designers.
*   [Confidentiality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidentiality "Confidentiality") is the nondisclosure of information except to another authorized person.[[117]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security#cite_note-117)
*   [Cryptographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography "Cryptography") techniques can be used to defend data in transit between systems, reducing the probability that data exchanged between systems can be intercepted or modified.
*   Cyberwarfare is an Internet-based conflict that involves politically motivated attacks on information and information systems. Such attacks can, for example, disable official websites and networks, disrupt or disable essential services, steal or alter classified data, and criple financial systems.
*   [Data integrity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_integrity "Data integrity") is the accuracy and consistency of stored data, indicated by an absence of any alteration in data between two updates of a data record.[[118]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security#cite_note-118)



[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Encryption_-_decryption.svg/300px-Encryption_-_decryption.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Encryption_-_decryption.svg)



[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Encryption_-_decryption.svg "Enlarge")

[Cryptographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography "Cryptography") techniques involve transforming information, scrambling it so it becomes unreadable during transmission. The intended recipient can unscramble the message; ideally, eavesdroppers cannot.





*   [Encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption "Encryption") is used to protect the message from the eyes of others. [Cryptographically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography "Cryptography") secure [ciphers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipher "Cipher") are designed to make any practical attempt of [breaking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptanalysis "Cryptanalysis") infeasible. [Symmetric-key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric-key_algorithm "Symmetric-key algorithm") ciphers are suitable for bulk encryption using [shared keys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_key "Shared key"), and [public-key encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_encryption "Public-key encryption") using [digital certificates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_certificate "Digital certificate") can provide a practical solution for the problem of securely communicating when no key is shared in advance.
*   Endpoint security software helps networks to prevent exfiltration (data theft) and virus infection at network entry points made vulnerable by the prevalence of potentially infected portable computing devices, such as laptops and mobile devices, and external storage devices, such as USB drives.[[119]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security#cite_note-119)
*   [Firewalls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firewall_(networking) "Firewall (networking)") are an important method for control and security on the Internet and other networks. A network firewall can be a communications processor, typically a router, or a dedicated server, along with firewall software. A firewall serves as a gatekeeper system that protects a company's intranets and other computer networks from intrusion by providing a filter and safe transfer point for access to and from the Internet and other networks. It screens all network traffic for proper passwords or other security codes and only allows authorized transmission in and out of the network. Firewalls can deter, but not completely prevent, unauthorized access (hacking) into computer networks; they can also provide some protection from online intrusion.
*   [Honey pots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeypot_(computing) "Honeypot (computing)") are computers that are either intentionally or unintentionally left vulnerable to attack by crackers. They can be used to catch crackers or fix vulnerabilities.
*   [Intrusion-detection systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrusion-detection_system "Intrusion-detection system") can scan a network for people that are on the network but who should not be there or are doing things that they should not be doing, for example trying a lot of passwords to gain access to the network.
*   A [microkernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microkernel "Microkernel") is the near-minimum amount of software that can provide the mechanisms to implement an operating system. It is used solely to provide very low-level, very precisely defined machine code upon which an operating system can be developed. A simple example is the early '90s GEMSOS (Gemini Computers), which provided extremely low-level machine code, such as "segment" management, atop which an operating system could be built. The theory (in the case of "segments") was that—rather than have the operating system itself worry about mandatory access separation by means of military-style labeling—it is safer if a low-level, independently scrutinized module can be charged **solely** with the management of individually labeled segments, be they memory "segments" or file system "segments" or executable text "segments." If software below the visibility of the operating system is (as in this case) charged with labeling, there is no theoretically viable means for a clever hacker to subvert the labeling scheme, since the operating system _per se_ does **not** provide mechanisms for interfering with labeling: the operating system is, essentially, a client (an "application," arguably) atop the microkernel and, as such, subject to its restrictions.
*   [Pinging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping_(networking_utility) "Ping (networking utility)") The ping application can be used by potential crackers to find if an IP address is reachable. If a cracker finds a computer, they can try a port scan to detect and attack services on that computer.
*   [Social engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_(computer_security) "Social engineering (computer security)") awareness keeps employees aware of the dangers of social engineering and/or having a policy in place to prevent social engineering can reduce successful breaches of the network and servers.
