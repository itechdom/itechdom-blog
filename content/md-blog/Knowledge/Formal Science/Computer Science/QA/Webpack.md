### Modules bundling
## 7\. Multiple entrypoints

Let's say you have a profile page and a feed page. You don't want to make the user download the code for the feed if they just want the profile. So make multiple bundles: create one "main module" (called an entrypoint) per page:



// webpack.config.js
module.exports = {
  entry: {
    Profile: './profile.js',
    Feed: './feed.js'
  },
  output: {
    path: 'build',
    filename: '[name].js' // Template based on keys in entry above
  }
};



For profile, insert `` into your page. Do a similar thing for feed.
### Optimizing Shared Code
## 8\. Optimizing common code

Feed and Profile share a lot in common (like React and the common stylesheets and components). webpack can figure out what they have in common and make a shared bundle that can be cached between pages:



// webpack.config.js

var webpack = require('webpack');

var commonsPlugin =
  new webpack.optimize.CommonsChunkPlugin('common.js');

module.exports = {
  entry: {
    Profile: './profile.js',
    Feed: './feed.js'
  },
  output: {
    path: 'build',
    filename: '[name].js' // Template based on keys in entry above
  },
  plugins: [commonsPlugin]
};



Add `` before the script tag you added in the previous step and enjoy the free caching.
### Async loading
## 9\. Async loading

CommonJS is synchronous but webpack provides a way to asynchronously specify dependencies. This is useful for client-side routers, where you want the router on every page, but you don't want to have to download features until you actually need them.

Specify the **split point** where you want to load asynchronously. For example:



if (window.location.pathname === '/feed') {
  showLoadingState();
  require.ensure([], function() { // this syntax is weird but it works
    hideLoadingState();
    require('./feed').show(); // when this function is called, the module is guaranteed to be synchronously available.
  });
} else if (window.location.pathname === '/profile') {
  showLoadingState();
  require.ensure([], function() {
    hideLoadingState();
    require('./profile').show();
  });
}



webpack will do the rest and generate extra **chunk** files and load them for you.

webpack will assume that those files are in your root directory when you load then into a html script tag for example. You can use `output.publicPath` to configure that.



// webpack.config.js
output: {
    path: "/home/proj/public/assets", //path to where webpack will build your stuff
    publicPath: "/assets/" //path that will be considered when requiring your files
}
