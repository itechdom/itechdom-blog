### use case
### you want to transform this data
Given some data like the following:

one   first example

two   second example

three   third example

four   fourth example

suppose you want to change the data to make a dictionary for a Python program, with this result:

data = {

    'one': 'first example',

    'two': 'second example',

    'three': 'third example',

    'four': 'fourth example',

}



To do this, record a macro while changing the first line. Then, playback the macro to change each other line. When finished, manually insert the initial "data = {" line, and the final "}" line.

The following shows one way to record a suitable macro.

Put the cursor on the first line.

Type qd (the q starts recording; the d is the register where keys will be recorded).

Type the following command to change the first sequence of whitespace to "': '":

:s/\s\+/': ' (then press Enter)

Type the following to insert four spaces followed by "'" at the start of the line:

I    ' (then press Escape)

Type the following to append "'," to the line:

A', (then press Escape)

Type the following to move the cursor to the start of the line, then down to the next line:

0j

Type q to stop recording the macro.

The cursor should now be on the second line. Type @d to playback the macro once. That should change the second line, with the cursor finishing on the third line. Type 2@@ to finish. The 2 means that what follows is performed twice, and the @@ plays back the last used macro. Instead of 2@@, you could type @d or @@ twice.


### a nice mapping
Running a macroEdit

Use this mapping as a convenient way to play a macro recorded to register q:

:nnoremap  @q

Start recording keystrokes by typing qq.

End recording with q (first press Escape if you are in insert mode).

Play the recorded keystrokes by hitting space.

Suppose you have a macro which operates on the text in a single line. You can run the macro on each line in a visual selection in a single operation:

Visually select some lines (for example, type vip to select the current paragraph).

Type :normal @q to run the macro from register q on each line.
### I stopped at saving a macro
### >>
### indent line
### ~
### toggle case, upper and lower
### #
### this will locate all the words within the file
### $
### End of line
### %
### matches braces , patentheses
### * 
### next matching
### O
### insert a line above
### P
### paste before
### a
### append after a chatacter
### A
### append at the end of a line
### s
### remove char & insert
### S
### remove line and insert mode
### .
### repeat command
### so If i indented the line once I can just type it and it will repeat
### %s
### replace
