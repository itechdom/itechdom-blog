### Container
this message appears when you run docker run hello-world



Hello from Docker.

This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:

 1\. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.

 2\. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.

 3\. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the

    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.

 4\. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it

    to your terminal.


### ubuntu bash example
docker run -it ubuntu bash

  -i, --interactive=false         Keep STDIN open even if not attached  


  -t, --tty=false                 Allocate a pseudo-TTY  

### https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/dockerizing/
### Streaming input and outputs
You can pass commands to docker containers so they can run them

docker run -d ubuntu:14.04 /bin/sh -c "while true; do echo hello world; sleep 1; done"  

### Daemon
## A daemonized Hello world

## 

Now a container that runs a command and then exits has some uses but it’s not overly helpful. Let’s create a container that runs as a daemon, like most of the applications we’re probably going to run with Docker.

Again we can do this with the `docker run` command:

    $ docker run -d ubuntu:14.04 /bin/sh -c "while true; do echo hello world; sleep 1; done"
    1e5535038e285177d5214659a068137486f96ee5c2e85a4ac52dc83f2ebe4147

Wait, what? Where’s our “hello world” output? Let’s look at what we’ve run here. It should look pretty familiar. We ran `docker run` but this time we specified a flag: `-d`. The `-d` flag tells Docker to run the container and put it in the background, to daemonize it.

We also specified the same image: `ubuntu:14.04`.

Finally, we specified a command to run:

    /bin/sh -c "while true; do echo hello world; sleep 1; done"

This is the (hello) world’s silliest daemon: a shell script that echoes `hello world`forever.

So why aren’t we seeing any `hello world`’s? Instead Docker has returned a really long string:

    1e5535038e285177d5214659a068137486f96ee5c2e85a4ac52dc83f2ebe4147

This really long string is called a _container ID_. It uniquely identifies a container so we can work with it.

> **Note:** The container ID is a bit long and unwieldy. A bit later, we’ll see a shorter ID and ways to name our containers to make working with them easier.

We can use this container ID to see what’s happening with our `hello world`daemon.

Firstly let’s make sure our container is running. We can do that with the `docker ps`command. The `docker ps` command queries the Docker daemon for information about all the containers it knows about.

    $ docker ps
    CONTAINER ID  IMAGE         COMMAND               CREATED        STATUS       PORTS NAMES
    1e5535038e28  ubuntu:14.04  /bin/sh -c 'while tr  2 minutes ago  Up 1 minute        insane_babbage

Here we can see our daemonized container. The `docker ps` has returned some useful information about it, starting with a shorter variant of its container ID:`1e5535038e28`.

We can also see the image we used to build it, `ubuntu:14.04`, the command it is running, its status and an automatically assigned name, `insane_babbage`.

> **Note:** Docker automatically generates names for any containers started. We’ll see how to specify your own names a bit later.

Okay, so we now know it’s running. But is it doing what we asked it to do? To see this we’re going to look inside the container using the `docker logs` command. Let’s use the container name Docker assigned.

    $ docker logs insane_babbage
    hello world
    hello world
    hello world
    . . .

The `docker logs` command looks inside the container and returns its standard output: in this case the output of our command `hello world`.

Awesome! Our daemon is working and we’ve just created our first Dockerized application!

Now we’ve established we can create our own containers let’s tidy up after ourselves and stop our detached container. To do this we use the `docker stop` command.

    $ docker stop insane_babbage
    insane_babbage

The `docker stop` command tells Docker to politely stop the running container. If it succeeds it will return the name of the container it has just stopped.

Let’s check it worked with the `docker ps` command.

    $ docker ps
    CONTAINER ID  IMAGE         COMMAND               CREATED        STATUS       PORTS NAMES

Excellent. Our container has been stopped.

### docker machine
**Machine** lets you create **Docker** hosts on your computer, on cloud providers, and inside your own data center. It automatically creates hosts, installs **Docker** on them, then configures the **docker** client to talk to them. A “**machine**” is the combination of a **Docker** host and a configured client.
