#Env Setup
#### Debugging Assets<br>As we mentioned in the beginning, the whole idea of the asset pipeline is to concatenate everything into one file, because performance. But, we'll notice that when we spin up our application in development, we'll see many files listed in the resources tab of the Chrome Developer Tools.<br>Open config/environments/development.rb<br>config.assets.debug = true<br>This is because this functionality is disabled in config/environments/development.rb:Debug mode disables concatenation and preprocessing of assets. This option causes significant delays in view rendering with a large number of complex assets. However it is useful for debugging.This option is turned off in production.<br>#### Precompile assets<br>If you request an asset in development, Rails will check public/assets first. If your asset is not there, it will hit up the asset pipeline and compile it on the fly. This is useful in development because you're likely to be making frequent changes and edits to those files. But, it would also be a performance bottleneck in production if Rails had to compile those files on every request.<br>Your assets have to be either required in your asset pipeline or precompiled<br>To do so, you can either include them in the manifest or indicate your app to precompile it.<br>In app/assets/stylesheets/application.css<br>// = require_self// = require 'site'<br><br>Let's say you had a stylesheet called site.css.scss. You could simply require it in application.css.<br>In config/initializers/assets.rb<br>config.assets.precompile += %w( site.css )<br>Alternatively, you can add it to the precompile list similar to the way we added a load path earlier.However, in practice, by establishing the require_tree ., Rails got you covered.<br>#### What happens when we precompile?<br>When you run rake assets:precompile, Rails goes through your assets and copies everything over to public/assets. It then creates application.js and application.css by reading the manifests. It does not look at any other file unless you explicitly tell it to.When using config.assets.precompile, the file extension of the target file matters. config.assets.precompile += %w( site ) will not work.JavaScripts and stylesheets must either be included in a manifest or explicitly added to the config.assets.precompile directive.<br>Rails copies all the assets into  public/assetsRails then creates an application.js and application.css by reading the manifestsWhen using config.assets.precompile, the file extension matters.&nbsp;<br>When you run rake assets:precompile, Rails goes through your assets and copies everything over to public/assets.

#Asset Pipeline
#What?
#### What<br>The asset pipeline provides a framework to concatenate and minify or compress JavaScript and CSS assets. It also adds the ability to write these assets in other languages and pre-processors such as CoffeeScript, Sass and ERB.The asset pipeline is technically no longer a core feature of Rails 4, it has been extracted out of the framework into the sprockets-rails gem that is included in your Rails projects.The asset pipeline is enabled by default.<br>#### Main Features<br>Asset concatenationAsset minificationPrecompilation<br>The first feature of the pipeline is to concatenate assets, which can reduce the number of requests that a browser makes to render a web page. Fewer requests can mean faster loading for your application.Sprockets concatenates all JavaScript files into one master .js file and all CSS files into one master .css file. You can customize this strategy to group files any way you like.In production, Rails inserts an MD5 fingerprint into each filename so that the file is cached by the web browser. You can invalidate the cache by altering this fingerprint, which happens automatically whenever you change the file contents.The second feature of the asset pipeline is asset minification or compression. For CSS files, this is done by removing whitespace and comments. For JavaScript, more complex processes can be applied. You can choose from a set of built in options or specify your own.The third feature of the asset pipeline is it allows coding assets via a higher-level language, with precompilation down to the actual assets. Supported languages include Sass for CSS, CoffeeScript for JavaScript, and ERB for both by default.<br>#### Fingerprinting<br>Fingerprinting is a technique that makes the name of a file dependent on the contents of the file. When the file contents change, the filename is also changed. For content that is static or infrequently changed, this provides an easy way to tell whether two versions of a file are identical, even across different servers or deployment dates.When a filename is unique and based on its content, HTTP headers can be set to encourage caches everywhere (whether at CDNs, at ISPs, in networking equipment, or in web browsers) to keep their own copy of the content. When the content is updated, the fingerprint will change. This will cause the remote clients to request a new copy of the content. This is generally known as cache busting.The technique sprockets uses for fingerprinting is to insert a hash of the content into the name, usually at the end. For example a CSS file global.css<br><br>#### Fingerprinting Example<br>global.css<br>global-908e25f4bf641868d8683022a5b62f54.css<br><br>This is the how Rails names an asset file with MD5 fingerprinting. Every time that the contents of the file change, Rails create a new filename forcing the browser to load it’s contents again.Rails used to attach a date at the end of the filename, but that strategy had three problems:<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre"><span style="white-space: normal;">	- Not all caches reliably cached filenames when used a date parameter<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre"><span style="white-space: normal;">	- If different nodes had different time stamps, then you could get many different asset names per node.<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre"><span style="white-space: normal;">	- If you deployed, it didn’t matter whether the contents had change, the cache was going to be invalidated therefore loading all the assets again.<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre"><span style="white-space: normal;">	global.css<br>/stylesheets/global.css?1309495796<br>This is how the asset file looked before in Rails.
#Asset Organization
#### Asset Organization<br>Pipeline assets can be placed inside an application in one of three locations: app/assets, lib/assets or vendor/assets.<br><br>#### Main Folders<br>app/assetslib/assetsvendor/assets<br>app/assets is for assets that are owned by the application, such as custom images, JavaScript files or stylesheets.lib/assets is for your own libraries' code that doesn't really fit into the scope of the application or those libraries which are shared across applications.vendor/assets is for assets that are owned by outside entities, such as code for JavaScript plugins and CSS frameworks. Keep in mind that third party code with references to other files also processed by the asset Pipeline (images, stylesheets, etc.), will need to be rewritten to use helpers like asset_path.<br><br>#### Asset directories are arbitrary<br>By default, Rails places three sub-directories in your app/assets directory. These are completely arbitrary. You can name these directories whatever you want or add other directories.Rails will pick up new files in your app/assets directory, but you have to reset the server if you add a new directory to the app/assets.Anything in the pipeline will be available at the /assets URL. So, the app/assets/javascripts/application.js in your asset pipeline will be available in development at http://localhost:3000/assets/application.js. app/assets/stylesheets/application.css will also be available at the root of your asset directory.&nbsp;The asset pipeline will completely flatten your directory structure when you spin up your development server or precompile your assets.<br><br>#### Example<br>app/assets/javascripts/home.jslib/assets/javascripts/moovinator.jsvendor/assets/tino_cochino/slider.jsvendor/assets/barbie_hair/phonebox.js<br>Let’s say that you have these files under your assets. Rails doesn’t care the subfolders that you use. It will flatten them all and put them under the assets url.<br>http://localhost:3000/assets/home.js&nbsp;http://localhost:3000/assets/moovinator.js&nbsp;http://localhost:3000/assets/slider.js&nbsp;http://localhost:3000/assets/phonebox.js<br>This will be referenced like this.
#Asset Lookup
#### Asset Lookup<br>Enter this in the rails console<br>> y Rails.application.config.assets.paths<br>At it's core, the asset pipeline is a list of load paths. You can see these load paths by firing up the Rails console.The y method just formats the hash as YAML.<br>This is my load path<br>---- "/Users/Jorge/Dropbox/projects/classes/storedom/app/assets/images"- "/Users/Jorge/Dropbox/projects/classes/storedom/app/assets/javascripts"- "/Users/Jorge/Dropbox/projects/classes/storedom/app/assets/stylesheets"- "/Users/Jorge/Dropbox/projects/classes/storedom/vendor/assets/javascripts"- "/Users/Jorge/Dropbox/projects/classes/storedom/vendor/assets/stylesheets"- "/Users/Jorge/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.1.3/gems/less-rails-bootstrap-3.2.0/app/assets/fonts"- "/Users/Jorge/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.1.3/gems/less-rails-bootstrap-3.2.0/app/assets/javascripts"- "/Users/Jorge/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.1.3/gems/less-rails-bootstrap-3.2.0/app/assets/stylesheets"- "/Users/Jorge/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.1.3/gems/turbolinks-2.2.2/lib/assets/javascripts"- "/Users/Jorge/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.1.3/gems/jquery-rails-3.1.1/vendor/assets/javascripts"- "/Users/Jorge/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.1.3/gems/coffee-rails-4.0.1/lib/assets/javascripts"<br>The asset pipeline works its way through your load path. The first asset with a given name wins.&nbsp;If you had an asset named app/assets/stylesheet.css.scss and another called vendor/assets/stylesheet.css.scss, the asset in your app/assets directory would win because it occurs first in the load path.<br>Adding to the Search Path<br>By default, Rails will search the first set of directories directly under app/assets, lib/assets, vendor/assets. You can add additional paths to the asset pipeline.Let's say you're living in the future and you want to include some Adobe Flash. And you want to store your flashy Flash apps in app/flash/assets—in an effort from infecting your other assets with a case of the early 2000s. You can add that path to the asset pipeline in config/initializers/assets.rb.<br>Add this line to the config/initializers/assets.rb<br>Rails.application.config.assets.paths << Rails.root.join("app", "flash", "assets")<br>create a flashy.txt file<br>$ touch app/flash/assets/flashy.txt<br>put this into flashy.txt<br>Rockin’ like 2002<br>visit this path<br>http://localhost:3000/assets/flashy.txt
#Manifests
#### What are Manifests?<br>Manifests are a way to pull in other, related files. So, if I request application.js and it requires another.js in it's manifest, I will get both of them.<br>#### Application.js<br>Let’s look at the application.js<br>// require_tree// require_directory .Define the files manually<br>// require_tree . requires all of the files in that directory and all subdirectories.// require_directory . loads all of the files in the directory but not the subdirectories.Alternatively, you can manually define the files you want to include.In this example, we're looking at application.js; so, we're using JavaScript comments. If you're in application.css then it would be in CSS comments.<br><br>//= require jquery//= require jquery_ujs//= require twitter/bootstrap//= require turbolinks//= require_tree .<br>This is the application.js in Storedom.Remember that order matters.<br>#### Manifest Directives<br>requireinclude&nbsp;require_selfrequire_directoryrequire_treedepend_onstub<br>require grabs an asset and puts it in our bundle once.include works a lot like require, but it will allow you to include a file more than once. (I have yet to find a practical use for this directive.)require_self tells Sprockets to load the body of the current file before loading any of the dependencies. You would use this if you wrote any styles or JavaScript in application.css or application.js respectively and you wanted Sprockets to load that code before loading any of the required assets.require_directory requires all of the source files of the same format in a given directory. It only goes one level deep.require_tree works like require_directory, but it also traverses subdirectories.depend_on announces that you depend on a file, but does not include it in the asset bundle.stub blacklists a dependency from the bundle.<br><br>#### SASS / SCSS<br>Use @import instead of require
#ActionView helpers
#### ActionView Helpers<br><%= stylesheet_link_tag "application", :media => "all" %><%= javascript_include_tag "application" %> &nbsp;<br>You’ve probably seen this.ActionView gives you a set of helper methods that you can use in your views to include assets.<br>audio_path("horse.wav") &nbsp;# /audios/horse.wavaudio_tag("sound") &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # <audio src="/audios/sound"/>font_path("font.ttf") &nbsp; &nbsp;# /fonts/font.ttfimage_path("edit.png") &nbsp; # "/images/edit.png"image_tag("dog.png") &nbsp; &nbsp; # <img src="/images/dog.png" alt="Dog"/>video_path("hd.avi") &nbsp; &nbsp; # /videos/hd.avivideo_tag("trailer.ogg") # <video src="/videos/trailer.ogg"/><br>See ActionView::Helpers::AssetTagHelper documentation for more information.The sass-rails gem also has a set of helpers that allow you to reference other assets without having to know their exact location. This should help you resist the temptation of using ERB in your .scss assets.
