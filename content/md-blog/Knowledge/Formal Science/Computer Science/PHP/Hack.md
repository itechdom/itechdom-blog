### Implementations
While Zend PHP is still the most popular implementation, several other implementations have been developed. Some of these are [compilers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler "Compiler") or support [JIT compilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JIT_compilation "JIT compilation"), and hence offer performance benefits over Zend PHP at the expense of lacking full PHP compatibility. Alternative implementations include the following:

*   [HipHop Virtual Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HipHop_Virtual_Machine "HipHop Virtual Machine") (HHVM) – developed at Facebook and available as open source, it converts PHP code into a high-level bytecode (commonly known as an [intermediate language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_language "Intermediate language")), which is then translated into x86-64 machine code dynamically at runtime by a [just-in-time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compiler "Just-in-time compiler") (JIT) compiler, resulting in up to 6× performance improvements.<sup id="cite_ref-112" class="reference" style="line-height: 1; font-size: 11.1999998092651px; unicode-bidi: -webkit-isolate;">[[112]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP#cite_note-112)</sup>
*   [Parrot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parrot_virtual_machine "Parrot virtual machine") – a virtual machine designed to run dynamic languages efficiently; Pipp transforms the PHP source code into the [Parrot intermediate representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parrot_intermediate_representation "Parrot intermediate representation"), which is then translated into the Parrot's bytecode and executed by the virtual machine.
*   [Phalanger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phalanger_(compiler) "Phalanger (compiler)") – compiles PHP into [Common Intermediate Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Intermediate_Language "Common Intermediate Language") (CIL) bytecode
*   [HipHop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HipHop_for_PHP "HipHop for PHP") – developed at Facebook and available as open source, it transforms the PHP scripts into [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B "C++") code and then compiles the resulting code, reducing the server load up to 50%. In early 2013, Facebook deprecated it in favor of HHVM due to multiple reasons, including deployment difficulties and lack of support for the whole PHP language, including the <tt style="font-family: monospace, Courier;">create_function()</tt> and <tt style="font-family: monospace, Courier;">eval()</tt> constructs.<sup id="cite_ref-113" class="reference" style="line-height: 1; font-size: 11.1999998092651px; unicode-bidi: -webkit-isolate;">[[113]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP#cite_note-113)</sup>
