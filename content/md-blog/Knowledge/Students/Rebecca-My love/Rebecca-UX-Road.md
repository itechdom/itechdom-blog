### The Design Proess
User experience design incorporates most or all of the above disciplines to positively impact the overall experience a person has with a particular interactive system, and its provider. User experience design most frequently defines a sequence of interactions between a user (individual person) and a system, virtual or physical, designed to meet or support user needs and goals, primarily, while also satisfying systems requirements and organizational objectives.Typical outputs include:Site audit (usability study of existing assets)Flows and navigation mapsUser stories or scenariosUser segmentations and persona (fictitious users to act out the scenarios)Site maps and content inventoryWireframes (screen blueprints or storyboards)Prototypes (for interactive or in-the-mind simulation)Written specifications (describing the behavior or design)Graphic mockups (precise visual of the expected end result)General design process[edit]The steps involved in the process are:Collecting information about the problemThe UX designer needs to find out as much as he can about people, process and products before the design phase. The designers can do this by meeting with the clients frequently in order to know what the client requirements are. Designers can also conduct user interviews in the users' work space in order to familiarize themselves with the target user base.Getting ready to designThis is the artistic phase of the designer. The designer uses paper prototyping and white boarding to come up with a basic design from the data collected about the problem. The design problem is refined in the later stages.DesignLow fidelity design prototypes created in the earlier step are refined. The high fidelity prototypes are left for the visual designers.Test and iterateUsability testing is carried out on the low fidelity prototypes. The target users are given various tasks to perform on the prototypes. Any issues or problems faced by the users are collected as field notes and these notes are used to make changes in the design and reiterate the testing phase.[13]
### The field is related to
As with the fields mentioned above, user experience design is a highly multi-disciplinary field, incorporating aspects of psychology, anthropology, architecture, sociology, computer science, graphic design, industrial design and cognitive science. Depending on the purpose of the product, UX may also involve content design disciplines such as communication design, instructional design, and game design. The subject matter of the content may also warrant collaboration with a subject-matter expert on planning the UX from various backgrounds in business, government, or private groups. More recently, content strategy has come to represent a sub-field of UX.
