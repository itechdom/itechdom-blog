### Patterns
Design PatternsIn software engineering, a design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. A design pattern isn't a finished design that can be transformed directly into code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.Uses of Design PatternsDesign patterns can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms. Effective software design requires considering issues that may not become visible until later in the implementation. Reusing design patterns helps to prevent subtle issues that can cause major problems and improves code readability for coders and architects familiar with the patterns.Often, people only understand how to apply certain software design techniques to certain problems. These techniques are difficult to apply to a broader range of problems. Design patterns provide general solutions, documented in a format that doesn't require specifics tied to a particular problem.In addition, patterns allow developers to communicate using well-known, well understood names for software interactions. Common design patterns can be improved over time, making them more robust than ad-hoc designs.Creational design patternsThese design patterns are all about class instantiation. This pattern can be further divided into class-creation patterns and object-creational patterns. While class-creation patterns use inheritance effectively in the instantiation process, object-creation patterns use delegation effectively to get the job done.Abstract FactoryCreates an instance of several families of classesBuilderSeparates object construction from its representationFactory MethodCreates an instance of several derived classesObject PoolAvoid expensive acquisition and release of resources by recycling objects that are no longer in usePrototypeA fully initialized instance to be copied or clonedSingletonA class of which only a single instance can existStructural design patternsThese design patterns are all about Class and Object composition. Structural class-creation patterns use inheritance to compose interfaces. Structural object-patterns define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionality.AdapterMatch interfaces of different classesBridgeSeparates an object’s interface from its implementationCompositeA tree structure of simple and composite objectsDecoratorAdd responsibilities to objects dynamicallyFacadeA single class that represents an entire subsystemFlyweightA fine-grained instance used for efficient sharingPrivate Class DataRestricts accessor/mutator accessProxyAn object representing another objectBehavioral design patternsThese design patterns are all about Class's objects communication. Behavioral patterns are those patterns that are most specifically concerned with communication between objects.Chain of responsibilityA way of passing a request between a chain of objectsCommandEncapsulate a command request as an objectInterpreterA way to include language elements in a programIteratorSequentially access the elements of a collectionMediatorDefines simplified communication between classesMementoCapture and restore an object's internal stateNull ObjectDesigned to act as a default value of an objectObserverA way of notifying change to a number of classesStateAlter an object's behavior when its state changesStrategyEncapsulates an algorithm inside a classTemplate methodDefer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclassVisitorDefines a new operation to a class without change
### Architectural patterns
An architectural pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem insoftware architecture within a given context.[1]Architectural patterns are similar to software design patterns but have a broader scope. The architectural patterns address various issues in software engineering, such as computer hardwareperformance limitations, high availability and minimization of a business risk. Some architectural patterns have been implemented within software frameworks.

### Artificial Neural Networks
Artificial neural network – mathematical model or computational model that is inspired by the structure and/or functional aspects of biological neural networks
### Statistical Learning Model inspired by the brain
### Interconnected Nodes capable of Learning given a certain input
### Example: Handwriting recognition
For example, a neural network for handwriting recognition is defined by a set of input neurons which may be activated by the pixels of an input image. After being weighted and transformed by afunction (determined by the network's designer), the activations of these neurons are then passed on to other neurons. This process is repeated until finally, an output neuron is activated. This determines which character was read.

### Connectionism
ConnectionismConnectionism is a set of approaches in the fields of artificial intelligence, cognitive psychology, cognitive science, neuroscience, andphilosophy of mind, that models mental or behavioral phenomena as the emergent processes of interconnected networks of simple units. The term was introduced by Donald Hebb in the 1940's.[1] There are many forms of connectionism, but the most common forms use neural networkmodels.
### Activiation is an important concept: 
In most connectionist models, networks change over time. A closely related and very common aspect of connectionist models is activation. At any time, a unit in the network has an activation, which is a numerical value intended to represent some aspect of the unit. For example, if the units in the model are neurons, the activation could represent the probability that the neuron would generate an action potential spike. Activation typically spreads to all the other units connected to it. Spreading activation is always a feature of neural network models, and it is very common in connectionist models used by cognitive psychologists.
