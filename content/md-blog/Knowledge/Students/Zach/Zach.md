# Design Patterns



In software engineering, a design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. A design pattern isn't a finished design that can be transformed directly into code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.

### Uses of Design Patterns

Design patterns can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms. Effective software design requires considering issues that may not become visible until later in the implementation. Reusing design patterns helps to prevent subtle issues that can cause major problems and improves code readability for coders and architects familiar with the patterns.

Often, people only understand how to apply certain software design techniques to certain problems. These techniques are difficult to apply to a broader range of problems. Design patterns provide general solutions, documented in a format that doesn't require specifics tied to a particular problem.

In addition, patterns allow developers to communicate using well-known, well understood names for software interactions. Common design patterns can be improved over time, making them more robust than ad-hoc designs.

### [Creational design patterns](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/creational_patterns)

These design patterns are all about class instantiation. This pattern can be further divided into class-creation patterns and object-creational patterns. While class-creation patterns use inheritance effectively in the instantiation process, object-creation patterns use delegation effectively to get the job done.

[![Example of Abstract Factory](https://sourcemaking.com/files/v2/content/patterns/Abstract_Factory_example1.svg)](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/abstract_factory)

*   [Abstract Factory](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/abstract_factory "Provides a way to encapsulate a group of individual factories that have a common theme.")  
    Creates an instance of several families of classes
*   [Builder](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/builder "Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.")  
    Separates object construction from its representation
*   [Factory Method](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/factory_method "Defines a separate method for creating the objects, which subclasses can then override to specify the derived type of product that will be created.")  
    Creates an instance of several derived classes
*   [Object Pool](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/object_pool "Avoid expensive acquisition and release of resources by recycling objects that are no longer in use")

    A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned
*   [Singleton](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/singleton "Restricts instantiation of a class to one object.")  
    A class of which only a single instance can exist

### [Structural design patterns](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/structural_patterns)

These design patterns are all about Class and Object composition. Structural class-creation patterns use inheritance to compose interfaces. Structural object-patterns define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionality.

*   [Proxy](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/proxy "Class functioning as an interface to another thing.")  
    An object representing another object

### [Behavioral design patterns](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/behavioral_patterns)

These design patterns are all about Class's objects communication. Behavioral patterns are those patterns that are most specifically concerned with communication between objects.

### Architectural patterns


An **architectural pattern** is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem in[software architecture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_architecture "Software architecture") within a given context.[[1]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architectural_pattern#cite_note-TMD-1)Architectural patterns are similar to software [design patterns](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_pattern_(computer_science) "Design pattern (computer science)") but have a broader scope. The architectural patterns address various issues in [software engineering](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering "Software engineering"), such as [computer hardware](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_hardware "Computer hardware")performance limitations, [high availability](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_availability "High availability") and minimization of a [business risk](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_risk "Business risk"). Some architectural patterns have been implemented within [software frameworks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework "Software framework").

### Example: Handwriting recognition
For example, a neural network for [handwriting recognition](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handwriting_recognition "Handwriting recognition") is defined by a set of input neurons which may be activated by the pixels of an input image. After being weighted and transformed by a[function](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics) "Function (mathematics)") (determined by the network's designer), the activations of these neurons are then passed on to other neurons. This process is repeated until finally, an output neuron is activated. This determines which character was read.

### Connectionism
[Connectionism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectionism)



**Connectionism** is a set of approaches in the fields of [artificial intelligence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence "Artificial intelligence"), [cognitive psychology](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_psychology "Cognitive psychology"), [cognitive science](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_science "Cognitive science"), [neuroscience](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience "Neuroscience"), and[philosophy of mind](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mind "Philosophy of mind"), that models [mental](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind "Mind") or [behavioral](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior "Behavior") phenomena as the [emergent processes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence "Emergence") of _interconnected networks of simple units_. The term was introduced by [Donald Hebb](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Hebb "Donald Hebb") in the 1940's.[[1]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectionism#cite_note-1) There are many forms of connectionism, but the most common forms use [neural network](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network "Neural network")models.


### Activiation is an important concept: 
In most connectionist models, networks change over time. A closely related and very common aspect of connectionist models is _activation_. At any time, a unit in the network has an activation, which is a numerical value intended to represent some aspect of the unit. For example, if the units in the model are neurons, the activation could represent the [probability](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability "Probability") that the neuron would generate an [action potential](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential "Action potential") spike. Activation typically spreads to all the other units connected to it. Spreading activation is always a feature of neural network models, and it is very common in connectionist models used by [cognitive psychologists](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_psychology "Cognitive psychology").
