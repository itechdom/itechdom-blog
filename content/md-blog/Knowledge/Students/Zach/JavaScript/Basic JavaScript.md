# Variables
Explanation:Variables serve as a way for us to store different kinds of data ( characters, numbers, boolean). It's the most essential part of any program.Examples:var student= "Zach";We use quotes to denote that we are storing the "Zach" in the variable (Box) student. Think of var student as a box that we store the String (this is what we call a list of characters).Why do variables Exist?Simply because we can reuse them later. I can display the variable student somewhere else in my program or pass to a function (we will see that a little later).Exercises:If you are using Chrome, type: CTRL+SHIFT+I. This will open the developer console.Experiment with different variables.type: var student_number = 12345, then type entertype: alert(student), then press enterThis will display the name in a dialog.Also you can check out this link which explains the different types of variableshttp://gitbookio.gitbooks.io/javascript/content/basics/types.htmlAlternative Readings:Check out: http://gitbookio.gitbooks.io/javascript/content/basics/variables.htmlQuestions:Please list all your questions here and I will answer them as soon as possible.1. I think you meant to say "var student=12345". If that was a test i passed! haha. It opened a dialogue box and said 12345.2.

var baz = "42";
