# Variables
**Explanation:**



Variables serve as a way for us to store different kinds of data ( characters, numbers, boolean). It's the most essential part of any program.



**Examples:**

var student= "Zach";

We use quotes to denote that we are storing the "Zach" in the variable (Box) student. Think of **var student** as a box that we store the String (this is what we call a list of characters).

**Why do variables Exist?**

Simply because we can reuse them later. I can display the variable **student** somewhere else in my program or pass to a function (we will see that a little later).

**Exercises:**



*   If you are using Chrome, type: CTRL+SHIFT+I. This will open the developer console.
*   Experiment with different variables.  

*   type: **var student_number = 12345**, then type enter
*   type: **alert(student),** then press enter
*   This will display the name in a dialog.

1\. I think you meant to say "var student=12345". If that was a test i passed! haha. It opened a dialogue box and said 12345.

2\. It seems Javascript is a loosely typed language bc these two = right?

    var bar = 42;
    var baz = "42";
