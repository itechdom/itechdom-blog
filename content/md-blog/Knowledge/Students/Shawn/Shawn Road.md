### Example: Handwriting recognition
For example, a neural network for [handwriting recognition](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handwriting_recognition "Handwriting recognition") is defined by a set of input neurons which may be activated by the pixels of an input image. After being weighted and transformed by a[function](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics) "Function (mathematics)") (determined by the network's designer), the activations of these neurons are then passed on to other neurons. This process is repeated until finally, an output neuron is activated. This determines which character was read.

### Connectionism
[Connectionism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectionism)



**Connectionism** is a set of approaches in the fields of [artificial intelligence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence "Artificial intelligence"), [cognitive psychology](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_psychology "Cognitive psychology"), [cognitive science](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_science "Cognitive science"), [neuroscience](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience "Neuroscience"), and[philosophy of mind](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mind "Philosophy of mind"), that models [mental](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind "Mind") or [behavioral](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior "Behavior") phenomena as the [emergent processes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence "Emergence") of _interconnected networks of simple units_. The term was introduced by [Donald Hebb](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Hebb "Donald Hebb") in the 1940's.[[1]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectionism#cite_note-1) There are many forms of connectionism, but the most common forms use [neural network](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network "Neural network")models.


### Activiation is an important concept: 
In most connectionist models, networks change over time. A closely related and very common aspect of connectionist models is _activation_. At any time, a unit in the network has an activation, which is a numerical value intended to represent some aspect of the unit. For example, if the units in the model are neurons, the activation could represent the [probability](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability "Probability") that the neuron would generate an [action potential](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential "Action potential") spike. Activation typically spreads to all the other units connected to it. Spreading activation is always a feature of neural network models, and it is very common in connectionist models used by [cognitive psychologists](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_psychology "Cognitive psychology").
