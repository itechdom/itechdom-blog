### Computational NueroScience

### Studies the actual Nuerons in terms of their biological structure and simulate them
### Different from computational Learning theory 
### Software packages simulating Nerves

### It's somewhat puzzling how neurons can be uniform while being sparse. Artificial neural networks don't possess such quality
### Challenges
### Overhead in computation, efforts have been done to come up with faster algorithms
### Artificial Intellegence

### Artificial Neural Networks

### Statistical Learning Model inspired by the brain
### Interconnected Nodes capable of Learning given a certain input
### Example: Handwriting recognition

### One of the theories: Hebbian Learning, cell a takes part in stimulating cell b
