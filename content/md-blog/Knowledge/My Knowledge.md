### Wikipedia Article on Art
### Philosophers
### Essence of art
The nature of art has been described by philosopher Richard Wollheim as "one of the most elusive of the traditional problems of human culture".[15] Art has been defined as a vehicle for the expression or communication of emotions and ideas, a means for exploring and appreciating formal elements for their own sake, and as mimesis or representation. Art as mimesis has deep roots in the philosophy of Aristotle.[16] Leo Tolstoy identified art as a use of indirect means to communicate from one person to another.[16] Benedetto Croce and R.G. Collingwood advanced the idealist view that art expresses emotions, and that the work of art therefore essentially exists in the mind of the creator.[17][18] The theory of art as form has its roots in the philosophy of Immanuel Kant, and was developed in the early twentieth century by Roger Fry and Clive Bell. More recently, thinkers influenced byMartin Heidegger have interpreted art as the means by which a community develops for itself a medium for self-expression and interpretation.[19] George Dickie has offered aninstitutional theory of art that defines a work of art as any artifact upon which a qualified person or persons acting on behalf of the social institution commonly referred to as "the art world" has conferred "the status of candidate for appreciation".[20] Larry Shiner has described fine art as "not an essence or a fate but something we have made. Art as we have generally understood it is a European invention barely two hundred years old.”[21]
### What's Art?
Art is an act of expressing feelings, thoughts, and observations.[30] There is an understanding that is reached with the material as a result of handling it, which facilitates one's thought processes
### General Outline
Architecture, process and product of planning, designing and construction. Architectural works, in the material form of buildings, are often perceived as cultural and political symbols and as works of art.Arts and craftsAsemic writingAnimationCartoonCeramic artCollageComicsConceptual artDecollageDecorative artDesign, as a verb, it refers to the process of originating and developing a plan for a new object (machine, building, product, etc.). As a noun, it is used both for the final plan or proposal (a drawing, model, or other description), or the result of implementing that plan or proposal (the object produced).Fashion designGarden designGraphic designMotion graphic designWeb design, creation and maintenance of websitesDrawingFilmFound artGraffitiIllustrationConcept artInstallation artLand artMail artMixed mediaPaintingPhotographyPrintmakingEtchingLithographyScreen-printingSculptureTypographyVideo art
### Fine Art
The second, and more recent, sense of the word art as an abbreviation for creative art or fine art emerged in the early 17th century.[13] Fine art refers to a skill used to express the artist's creativity, or to engage the audience's aesthetic sensibilities, or to draw the audience towards consideration of more refined or finer work of art.
### Commercial Art
Often, if the skill is being used in a common or practical way, people will consider it a craft instead of art. Likewise, if the skill is being used in a commercial or industrial way, it may be considered commercial art instead of fine art
### interactive media

### Decorative
The decorative arts are arts or crafts concerned with the design and manufacture of beautiful objects that are also functional. It includesinterior design, but not usually architecture. The decorative arts are often categorized in opposition to the "fine arts", namely, painting,drawing, photography, and large-scale sculpture, which generally have no function other than to be seen
### Applied Arts
 On the other hand, crafts and design are sometimes considered applied art. Some art followers have argued that the difference between fine art and applied art has more to do with value judgments made about the art than any clear definitional difference.[14] However, even fine art often has goals beyond pure creativity and self-expression. The purpose of works of art may be to communicate ideas, such as in politically, spiritually, or philosophically motivated art; to create a sense of beauty (see aesthetics); to explore the nature of perception; for pleasure; or to generate strong emotions. The purpose may also be seemingly nonexistent.
### Visual Art
visual arts, which includes the creation of images or objects in fields including painting, sculpture, printmaking, photography, and other visual media.

### Modern Art
A common contemporary criticism of some modern art occurs along the lines of objecting to the apparent lack of skill or ability required in the production of the artistic object. In conceptual art, Marcel Duchamp's "Fountain" is among the first examples of pieces wherein the artist used found objects ("ready-made") and exercised no traditionally recognised set of skills. Tracey Emin's My Bed, or Damien Hirst's The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living follow this example and also manipulate the mass media. Emin slept (and engaged in other activities) in her bed before placing the result in a gallery as work of art. Hirst came up with the conceptual design for the artwork but has left most of the eventual creation of many works to employed artisans. Hirst's celebrity is founded entirely on his ability to produce shocking concepts. The actual production in many conceptual and contemporary works of art is a matter of assembly of found objects. However, there are many modernist and contemporary artists who continue to excel in the skills of drawing and painting and in creating hands-on works of art.

### Purpose of Art
### Non Motiviated
Non-motivated functions of artThe non-motivated purposes of art are those that are integral to being human, transcend the individual, or do not fulfill a specific external purpose. In this sense, Art, as creativity, is something humans must do by their very nature (i.e., no other species creates art), and is therefore beyond utility.Basic human instinct for harmony, balance, rhythm. Art at this level is not an action or an object, but an internal appreciation of balance and harmony (beauty), and therefore an aspect of being human beyond utility."Imitation, then, is one instinct of our nature. Next, there is the instinct for 'harmony' and rhythm, meters being manifestly sections of rhythm. Persons, therefore, starting with this natural gift developed by degrees their special aptitudes, till their rude improvisations gave birth to Poetry." -Aristotle[31]Experience of the mysterious. Art provides a way to experience one's self in relation to the universe. This experience may often come unmotivated, as one appreciates art, music or poetry."The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and science." -Albert Einstein[32]Expression of the imagination. Art provides a means to express the imagination in non-grammatic ways that are not tied to the formality of spoken or written language. Unlike words, which come in sequences and each of which have a definite meaning, art provides a range of forms, symbols and ideas with meanings that are malleable."Jupiter's eagle [as an example of art] is not, like logical (aesthetic) attributes of an object, the concept of the sublimity and majesty of creation, but rather something else – something that gives the imagination an incentive to spread its flight over a whole host of kindred representations that provoke more thought than admits of expression in a concept determined by words. They furnish an aesthetic idea, which serves the above rational idea as a substitute for logical presentation, but with the proper function, however, of animating the mind by opening out for it a prospect into a field of kindred representations stretching beyond its ken." -Immanuel Kant[33]Ritualistic and symbolic functions. In many cultures, art is used in rituals, performances and dances as a decoration or symbol. While these often have no specific utilitarian (motivated) purpose, anthropologists know that they often serve a purpose at the level of meaning within a particular culture. This meaning is not furnished by any one individual, but is often the result of many generations of change, and of a cosmological relationship within the culture."Most scholars who deal with rock paintings or objects recovered from prehistoric contexts that cannot be explained in utilitarian terms and are thus categorized as decorative, ritual or symbolic, are aware of the trap posed by the term 'art'." -Silva Tomaskova[34]
### Motivated
Motivated functions of artMotivated purposes of art refer to intentional, conscious actions on the part of the artists or creator. These may be to bring about political change, to comment on an aspect of society, to convey a specific emotion or mood, to address personal psychology, to illustrate another discipline, to (with commercial arts) to sell a product, or simply as a form of communication.Communication. Art, at its simplest, is a form of communication. As most forms of communication have an intent or goal directed toward another individual, this is a motivated purpose. Illustrative arts, such as scientific illustration, are a form of art as communication. Maps are another example. However, the content need not be scientific. Emotions, moods and feelings are also communicated through art."[Art is a set of] artefacts or images with symbolic meanings as a means of communication." -Steve Mithen[35]Art as entertainment. Art may seek to bring about a particular emotion or mood, for the purpose of relaxing or entertaining the viewer. This is often the function of the art industries of Motion Pictures and Video Games.[citation needed]The Avante-Garde. Art for political change. One of the defining functions of early twentieth-century art has been to use visual images to bring about political change. Art movements that had this goal—Dadaism, Surrealism, Russian constructivism, and Abstract Expressionism, among others—are collectively referred to as the avante-gardearts."By contrast, the realistic attitude, inspired by positivism, from Saint Thomas Aquinas to Anatole France, clearly seems to me to be hostile to any intellectual or moral advancement. I loathe it, for it is made up of mediocrity, hate, and dull conceit. It is this attitude which today gives birth to these ridiculous books, these insulting plays. It constantly feeds on and derives strength from the newspapers and stultifies both science and art by assiduously flattering the lowest of tastes; clarity bordering on stupidity, a dog's life." -André Breton (Surrealism)[36]Art as a "free zone", removed from the action of the social censure. Unlike the avant-garde movements, which wanted to erase cultural differences in order to produce new universal values, contemporary art has enhanced its tolerance towards cultural differences as well as its critical and liberating functions (social inquiry, activism, subversion, deconstruction...), becoming a more open place for research and experimentation.[37]Art for social inquiry, subversion and/or anarchy. While similar to art for political change, subversive or deconstructivist art may seek to question aspects of society without any specific political goal. In this case, the function of art may be simply to criticize some aspect of society.Spray-paint graffiti on a wall in RomeGraffiti art and other types of street art are graphics and images that are spray-painted or stencilled on publicly viewable walls, buildings, buses, trains, and bridges, usually without permission. Certain art forms, such as graffiti, may also be illegal when they break laws (in this case vandalism).Art for social causes. Art can be used to raise awareness for a large variety of causes. A number of art activities were aimed at raising awareness of autism,[38][39][40]cancer,[41][42][43] human trafficking,[44][45] and a variety of other topics, such as ocean conservation,[46] human rights in Darfur,[47] murdered and missing Aboriginal women,[48] elder abuse,[49] and pollution.[50] Trashion, using trash to make fashion, practiced by artists such as Marina DeBris is one example of using art to raise awareness about pollution.Art for psychological and healing purposes. Art is also used by art therapists, psychotherapists and clinical psychologists as art therapy. The Diagnostic Drawing Series, for example, is used to determine the personality and emotional functioning of a patient. The end product is not the principal goal in this case, but rather a process of healing, through creative acts, is sought. The resultant piece of artwork may also offer insight into the troubles experienced by the subject and may suggest suitable approaches to be used in more conventional forms of psychiatric therapy.Art for propaganda, or commercialism. Art is often utilized as a form of propaganda, and thus can be used to subtly influence popular conceptions or mood. In a similar way, art that tries to sell a product also influences mood and emotion. In both cases, the purpose of art here is to subtly manipulate the viewer into a particular emotional or psychological response toward a particular idea or object.[51]Art as a fitness indicator. It has been argued that the ability of the human brain by far exceeds what was needed for survival in the ancestral environment. One evolutionary psychology explanation for this is that the human brain and associated traits (such as artistic ability and creativity) are the human equivalent of the peacock's tail. The purpose of the male peacock's extravagant tail has been argued to be to attract females (see also Fisherian runaway and handicap principle). According to this theory superior execution of art was evolutionary important because it attracted mates.[52]The functions of art described above are not mutually exclusive, as many of them may overlap. For example, art for the purpose of entertainment may also seek to sell a product, i.e. the movie or video game.

### Patterns
Design PatternsIn software engineering, a design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. A design pattern isn't a finished design that can be transformed directly into code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.Uses of Design PatternsDesign patterns can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms. Effective software design requires considering issues that may not become visible until later in the implementation. Reusing design patterns helps to prevent subtle issues that can cause major problems and improves code readability for coders and architects familiar with the patterns.Often, people only understand how to apply certain software design techniques to certain problems. These techniques are difficult to apply to a broader range of problems. Design patterns provide general solutions, documented in a format that doesn't require specifics tied to a particular problem.In addition, patterns allow developers to communicate using well-known, well understood names for software interactions. Common design patterns can be improved over time, making them more robust than ad-hoc designs.Creational design patternsThese design patterns are all about class instantiation. This pattern can be further divided into class-creation patterns and object-creational patterns. While class-creation patterns use inheritance effectively in the instantiation process, object-creation patterns use delegation effectively to get the job done.Abstract FactoryCreates an instance of several families of classesBuilderSeparates object construction from its representationFactory MethodCreates an instance of several derived classesObject PoolAvoid expensive acquisition and release of resources by recycling objects that are no longer in usePrototypeA fully initialized instance to be copied or clonedSingletonA class of which only a single instance can existStructural design patternsThese design patterns are all about Class and Object composition. Structural class-creation patterns use inheritance to compose interfaces. Structural object-patterns define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionality.AdapterMatch interfaces of different classesBridgeSeparates an object’s interface from its implementationCompositeA tree structure of simple and composite objectsDecoratorAdd responsibilities to objects dynamicallyFacadeA single class that represents an entire subsystemFlyweightA fine-grained instance used for efficient sharingPrivate Class DataRestricts accessor/mutator accessProxyAn object representing another objectBehavioral design patternsThese design patterns are all about Class's objects communication. Behavioral patterns are those patterns that are most specifically concerned with communication between objects.Chain of responsibilityA way of passing a request between a chain of objectsCommandEncapsulate a command request as an objectInterpreterA way to include language elements in a programIteratorSequentially access the elements of a collectionMediatorDefines simplified communication between classesMementoCapture and restore an object's internal stateNull ObjectDesigned to act as a default value of an objectObserverA way of notifying change to a number of classesStateAlter an object's behavior when its state changesStrategyEncapsulates an algorithm inside a classTemplate methodDefer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclassVisitorDefines a new operation to a class without change
### Architectural patterns
An architectural pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem insoftware architecture within a given context.[1]Architectural patterns are similar to software design patterns but have a broader scope. The architectural patterns address various issues in software engineering, such as computer hardwareperformance limitations, high availability and minimization of a business risk. Some architectural patterns have been implemented within software frameworks.

### Compilers

### Converts one language to another
### Object Code
Object code, or sometimes an object module, is what a computer compiler produces.[1] In a general sense object code is a sequence of statements or instructions in a computer language,[2] usually a machine code language (i.e., binary) or an intermediate language such asRTL.
### Usually a machine code language
Machine code or machine language is a set of instructions executed directly by a computer's central processing unit (CPU). Each instruction performs a very specific task, such as a load, a jump, or anALU operation on a unit of data in a CPU register or memory. Every program directly executed by a CPU is made up of a series of such instructions.
### To create an executable program
### An Example of a simpler compiler
### https://github.com/esumii/min-caml
### Steps to create a compiler
IntroA typical compiler does the following steps:Parsing: the source text is converted to an abstract syntax tree (AST).Resolution of references to other modules (C postpones this step till linking).Semantic validation: weeding out syntactically correct statements that make no sense, e.g. unreachable code or duplicate declarations.Equivalent transformations and high-level optimization: the AST is transformed to represent a more efficient computation with the same semantics. This includes e.g. early calculation of common subexpressions and constant expressions, eliminating excessive local assignments, etc.Code generation: the AST is transformed into linear low-level code, with jumps, register allocation and the like. Some function calls can be inlined at this stage, some loops unrolled, etc.Peephole optimization: the low-level code is scanned for simple local inefficiencies which are eliminated.Most modern compilers (for instance, gcc and clang) repeat the last two steps once more. They use an intermediate low-level but platform-independent language for initial code generation. Then that language is converted into platform-specific code (x86, ARM, etc) doing roughly the same thing in a platform-optimized way. This includes e.g. the use of vector instructions when possible, instruction reordering to increase branch prediction efficiency, and so on.After that, object code is ready for linking. Most native-code compilers know how to call a linker to produce an executable, but it's not a compilation step per se. In languages like Java and C# linking may be totally dynamic, done by the VM at load time.Remember the basicsMake it workMake it beautifulMake it efficientThis classic sequence applies to all software development, but bears repetition.Concentrate on the first step of the sequence. Create the simplest thing that could possibly work.Read the books!Read the Dragon Book by Aho and Ullman. This is classic and is still quite applicable today.Modern Compiler Design is also praised.If this stuff is too hard for you right now, read some intros on parsing first; usually parsing libraries include intros and examples.Make sure you're comfortable working with graphs, especially trees. These things is the stuff programs are made of on the logical level.Define your language wellUse whatever notation you want, but make sure you have a complete and consistent description of your language. This includes both syntax and semantics.It's high time to write snippets of code in your new language as test cases for the future compiler.Use your favorite languageIt's totally OK to write a compiler in Python or Ruby or whatever language is easy for you. Use simple algorithms you understand well. The first version does not have to be fast, or efficient, or feature-complete. It only needs to be correct enough and easy to modify.It's also OK to write different stages of a compiler in different languages, if needed.Prepare to write a lot of testsYour entire language should be covered by test cases; effectively it will be defined by them. Get well-acquainted with your preferred testing framework. Write tests from day one. Concentrate on 'positive' tests that accept correct code, as opposed to detection of incorrect code.Run all the tests regularly. Fix broken tests before proceeding. It would be a shame to end up with an ill-defined language that cannot accept valid code.Create a good parserParser generators are many. Pick whatever you want. You may also write your own parser from scratch, but it only worth it if syntax of your language is dead simple.The parser should detect and report syntax errors. Write a lot of test cases, both positive and negative; reuse the code you wrote while defining the language.Output of your parser is an abstract syntax tree.If your language has modules, the output of the parser may be the simplest representation of 'object code' you generate. There are plenty of simple ways to dump a tree to a file and to quickly load it back.Create a semantic validatorMost probably your language allows for syntactically correct constructions that may make no sense in certain contexts. An example is a duplicate declaration of the same variable or passing a parameter of a wrong type. The validator will detect such errors looking at the tree.The validator will also resolve references to other modules written in your language, load these other modules and use in the validation process. For instance, this step will make sure that the number of parameters passed to a function from another module is correct.Again, write and run a lot of test cases. Trivial cases are as indispensable at troubleshooting as smart and complex.Generate codeUse the simplest techniques you know. Often it's OK to directly translate a language construct (like an if statement) to a lightly-parametrized code template, not unlike an HTML template.Again, ignore efficiency and concentrate on correctness.Target a platform-independent low-level VMI suppose that you ignore low-level stuff unless you're keenly interested in hardware-specific details. These details are gory and complex.Your options:LLVM: allows for efficient machine code generation, usually for x86 and ARM.CLR: targets .NET, mostly x86/Windows-based; has a good JIT.JVM: targets Java world, quite multiplatform, has a good JIT.Ignore optimizationOptimization is hard. Almost always optimization is premature. Generate inefficient but correct code. Implement the whole language before you try to optimize the resulting code.Of course, trivial optimizations are OK to introduce. But avoid any cunning, hairy stuff before your compiler is stable.So what?If all this stuff is not too intimidating for you, please proceed! For a simple language, each of the steps may be simpler that you think.Seeing a 'Hello world' from a program that your compiler created might be worth the effort.

For example, a neural network for handwriting recognition is defined by a set of input neurons which may be activated by the pixels of an input image. After being weighted and transformed by afunction (determined by the network's designer), the activations of these neurons are then passed on to other neurons. This process is repeated until finally, an output neuron is activated. This determines which character was read.

### https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebbian_theory
### Connectionism
ConnectionismConnectionism is a set of approaches in the fields of artificial intelligence, cognitive psychology, cognitive science, neuroscience, andphilosophy of mind, that models mental or behavioral phenomena as the emergent processes of interconnected networks of simple units. The term was introduced by Donald Hebb in the 1940's.[1] There are many forms of connectionism, but the most common forms use neural networkmodels.
### Activiation is an important concept: 
In most connectionist models, networks change over time. A closely related and very common aspect of connectionist models is activation. At any time, a unit in the network has an activation, which is a numerical value intended to represent some aspect of the unit. For example, if the units in the model are neurons, the activation could represent the probability that the neuron would generate an action potential spike. Activation typically spreads to all the other units connected to it. Spreading activation is always a feature of neural network models, and it is very common in connectionist models used by cognitive psychologists.

### Statistics
Statistics – collection, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data.Computational statistics – interface between statistics and computer science.Data mining – process that results in the discovery of new patterns in large data setsRegression – estimates the conditional expectation of the dependent variable given the independent variables – that is, the average value of the dependent variable when the independent variables are held fixed.Simulation – Simulation is the imitation of the operation of a real-world process or system over time. The act of simulating something first requires that a model be developed; this model represents the key characteristics or behaviors of the selected physical or abstract system or process. The model represents the system itself, whereas the simulation represents the operation of the system over time.Bootstrap (statistics) – method for assigning measures of accuracy to sample estimates (Efron and Tibshirani 1993).Design of experiments – design of any information-gathering exercises where variation is present, whether under the full control of the experimenter or notBlock design – set together with a family of subsets (repeated subsets are allowed at times) whose members are chosen to satisfy some set of properties that are deemed useful for a particular application.Analysis of variance – collection of statistical models, and their associated procedures, in which the observed variance in a particular variable is partitioned into components attributable to different sources of variation.Response surface methodology – explores the relationships between several explanatory variables and one or more response variables.Engineering statistics – Engineering statistics combines engineering and statisticsSpatial statistics – any of the formal techniques which study entities using their topological, geometric, or geographic properties.Social statistics – use of statistical measurement systems to study human behavior in a social environmentStatistical modelling – formalization of relationships between variables in the form of mathematical equationsBiostatistics – application of statistics to a wide range of topics in biology.Epidemiology – study of the distribution and patterns of health-events, health-characteristics and their causes or influences in well-defined populations.Multivariate analysis – observation and analysis of more than one statistical variable at a time.Structural equation model – statistical technique for testing and estimating causal relations using a combination of statistical data and qualitative causal assumptions.Time series – sequence of data points, measured typically at successive time instants spaced at uniform time intervals.Reliability theory – describes the probability of a system completing its expected function during an interval of time.Quality control – process by which entities review the quality of all factors involved in production.Statistical theory – provides a basis for the whole range of techniques, in both study design and data analysis, that are used within applications of statistics.Decision theory – identifies the values, uncertainties and other issues relevant in a given decision, its rationality, and the resulting optimal decision.Mathematical statistics – study of statistics from a mathematical standpoint, using probability theory as well as other branches of mathematics such as linear algebra and analysis.Probability – likelihood or chance that something is the case or will happen.Sample Survey – process of selecting a sample of elements from a target population in order to conduct a survey.Sampling theory – study of the collection, organization, analysis, and interpretation of data.Survey methodology – field that studies the sampling of individuals from a population with a view towards making statistical inferences about the population using the sample.
