### Purpose of Art
### Non Motiviated
### <span class="mw-headline" id="Non-motivated_functions_of_art">Non-motivated functions of art</span>

The non-motivated purposes of art are those that are integral to being human, transcend the individual, or do not fulfill a specific external purpose. In this sense, Art, as creativity, is something humans must do by their very nature (i.e., no other species creates art), and is therefore beyond utility.

1.  _[Basic human instinct for harmony, balance, rhythm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine_arts "Fine arts")._ Art at this level is not an action or an object, but an internal appreciation of balance and harmony (beauty), and therefore an aspect of being human beyond utility.

    > "Imitation, then, is one instinct of our nature. Next, there is the instinct for 'harmony' and rhythm, meters being manifestly sections of rhythm. Persons, therefore, starting with this natural gift developed by degrees their special aptitudes, till their rude improvisations gave birth to Poetry." -Aristotle<sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference" style="line-height: 1; font-size: 11.1999998092651px; display: inline-block;">[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art#cite_note-31)</sup>

2.  _Experience of the mysterious._ Art provides a way to experience one's self in relation to the universe. This experience may often come unmotivated, as one appreciates art, music or poetry.

    > "The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and science." -Albert Einstein<sup id="cite_ref-32" class="reference" style="line-height: 1; font-size: 11.1999998092651px; display: inline-block;">[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art#cite_note-32)</sup>

3.  _Expression of the imagination._ Art provides a means to express the imagination in non-grammatic ways that are not tied to the formality of spoken or written language. Unlike words, which come in sequences and each of which have a definite meaning, art provides a range of forms, symbols and ideas with meanings that are malleable.

    > "Jupiter's eagle [as an example of art] is not, like logical (aesthetic) attributes of an object, the concept of the sublimity and majesty of creation, but rather something else – something that gives the imagination an incentive to spread its flight over a whole host of kindred representations that provoke more thought than admits of expression in a concept determined by words. They furnish an aesthetic idea, which serves the above rational idea as a substitute for logical presentation, but with the proper function, however, of animating the mind by opening out for it a prospect into a field of kindred representations stretching beyond its ken." -Immanuel Kant<sup id="cite_ref-33" class="reference" style="line-height: 1; font-size: 11.1999998092651px; display: inline-block;">[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art#cite_note-33)</sup>

4.  _Ritualistic and symbolic functions._ In many cultures, art is used in rituals, performances and dances as a decoration or symbol. While these often have no specific utilitarian (motivated) purpose, anthropologists know that they often serve a purpose at the level of meaning within a particular culture. This meaning is not furnished by any one individual, but is often the result of many generations of change, and of a cosmological relationship within the culture.

    > "Most scholars who deal with rock paintings or objects recovered from prehistoric contexts that cannot be explained in utilitarian terms and are thus categorized as decorative, ritual or symbolic, are aware of the trap posed by the term 'art'." -Silva Tomaskova<sup id="cite_ref-34" class="reference" style="line-height: 1; font-size: 11.1999998092651px; display: inline-block;">[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art#cite_note-34)</sup>
### Motivated
### <span class="mw-headline" id="Motivated_functions_of_art">Motivated functions of art</span>

Motivated purposes of art refer to intentional, conscious actions on the part of the artists or creator. These may be to bring about political change, to comment on an aspect of society, to convey a specific emotion or mood, to address personal psychology, to illustrate another discipline, to (with commercial arts) to sell a product, or simply as a form of communication.

1.  _Communication._ Art, at its simplest, is a form of communication. As most forms of communication have an intent or goal directed toward another individual, this is a motivated purpose. Illustrative arts, such as scientific illustration, are a form of art as communication. Maps are another example. However, the content need not be scientific. Emotions, moods and feelings are also communicated through art.

    > "[Art is a set of] artefacts or images with symbolic meanings as a means of communication." -Steve Mithen<sup id="cite_ref-35" class="reference" style="line-height: 1; font-size: 11.1999998092651px; display: inline-block;">[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art#cite_note-35)</sup>

2.  _Art as entertainment_. Art may seek to bring about a particular emotion or mood, for the purpose of relaxing or entertaining the viewer. This is often the function of the art industries of Motion Pictures and Video Games.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="line-height: 1; font-size: 11.1999998092651px; white-space: nowrap;">[_[<span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (July 2013)">citation needed</span>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]</sup>
3.  _The Avante-Garde. Art for political change._ One of the defining functions of early twentieth-century art has been to use visual images to bring about political change. Art movements that had this goal—[Dadaism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dadaism "Dadaism"), [Surrealism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrealism "Surrealism"), [Russian constructivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_constructivism "Russian constructivism"), and [Abstract Expressionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_Expressionism "Abstract Expressionism"), among others—are collectively referred to as the _avante-garde_arts.

    > "By contrast, the realistic attitude, inspired by positivism, from Saint Thomas Aquinas to Anatole France, clearly seems to me to be hostile to any intellectual or moral advancement. I loathe it, for it is made up of mediocrity, hate, and dull conceit. It is this attitude which today gives birth to these ridiculous books, these insulting plays. It constantly feeds on and derives strength from the newspapers and stultifies both science and art by assiduously flattering the lowest of tastes; clarity bordering on stupidity, a dog's life." -André Breton (Surrealism)<sup id="cite_ref-36" class="reference" style="line-height: 1; font-size: 11.1999998092651px; display: inline-block;">[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art#cite_note-36)</sup>

4.  _Art as a "free zone"_, removed from the action of the social censure. Unlike the [avant-garde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avant-garde "Avant-garde") movements, which wanted to erase cultural differences in order to produce new universal values, [contemporary art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contemporary_art "Contemporary art") has enhanced its tolerance towards cultural differences as well as its critical and liberating functions (social inquiry, activism, subversion, deconstruction...), becoming a more open place for research and experimentation.<sup id="cite_ref-37" class="reference" style="line-height: 1; font-size: 11.1999998092651px; display: inline-block;">[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art#cite_note-37)</sup>
5.  _Art for social inquiry, subversion and/or anarchy._ While similar to art for political change, subversive or deconstructivist art may seek to question aspects of society without any specific political goal. In this case, the function of art may be simply to criticize some aspect of society.

    [Graffiti art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graffiti#Uses "Graffiti") and other types of [street art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_art "Street art") are graphics and images that are [spray-painted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spray_painting "Spray painting") or [stencilled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stencil "Stencil") on publicly viewable walls, buildings, buses, trains, and bridges, usually without permission. Certain art forms, such as graffiti, may also be illegal when they break laws (in this case vandalism).
6.  _Art for social causes._ Art can be used to raise awareness for a large variety of causes. A number of art activities were aimed at raising awareness of [autism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism "Autism"),<sup id="cite_ref-38" class="reference" style="line-height: 1; font-size: 11.1999998092651px; display: inline-block;">[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art#cite_note-38)</sup><sup id="cite_ref-39" class="reference" style="line-height: 1; font-size: 11.1999998092651px; display: inline-block;">[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art#cite_note-39)</sup><sup id="cite_ref-40" class="reference" style="line-height: 1; font-size: 11.1999998092651px; display: inline-block;">[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art#cite_note-40)</sup>cancer,<sup id="cite_ref-41" class="reference" style="line-height: 1; font-size: 11.1999998092651px; display: inline-block;">[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art#cite_note-41)</sup><sup id="cite_ref-42" class="reference" style="line-height: 1; font-size: 11.1999998092651px; display: inline-block;">[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art#cite_note-42)</sup><sup id="cite_ref-43" class="reference" style="line-height: 1; font-size: 11.1999998092651px; display: inline-block;">[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art#cite_note-43)</sup> [human trafficking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_trafficking "Human trafficking"),<sup id="cite_ref-44" class="reference" style="line-height: 1; font-size: 11.1999998092651px; display: inline-block;">[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art#cite_note-44)</sup><sup id="cite_ref-45" class="reference" style="line-height: 1; font-size: 11.1999998092651px; display: inline-block;">[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art#cite_note-45)</sup> and a variety of other topics, such as ocean conservation,<sup id="cite_ref-46" class="reference" style="line-height: 1; font-size: 11.1999998092651px; display: inline-block;">[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art#cite_note-46)</sup> human rights in [Darfur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darfur "Darfur"),<sup id="cite_ref-47" class="reference" style="line-height: 1; font-size: 11.1999998092651px; display: inline-block;">[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art#cite_note-47)</sup> murdered and missing Aboriginal women,<sup id="cite_ref-48" class="reference" style="line-height: 1; font-size: 11.1999998092651px; display: inline-block;">[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art#cite_note-48)</sup> elder abuse,<sup id="cite_ref-49" class="reference" style="line-height: 1; font-size: 11.1999998092651px; display: inline-block;">[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art#cite_note-49)</sup> and pollution.<sup id="cite_ref-50" class="reference" style="line-height: 1; font-size: 11.1999998092651px; display: inline-block;">[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art#cite_note-50)</sup> [Trashion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trashion "Trashion"), using trash to make fashion, practiced by artists such as [Marina DeBris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marina_DeBris "Marina DeBris") is one example of using art to raise awareness about pollution.
7.  _Art for psychological and healing purposes._ Art is also used by art therapists, psychotherapists and clinical psychologists as [art therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_therapy "Art therapy"). The [Diagnostic Drawing Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_therapy#The_Diagnostic_Drawing_Series_.28DDS.29 "Art therapy"), for example, is used to determine the personality and emotional functioning of a patient. The end product is not the principal goal in this case, but rather a process of healing, through creative acts, is sought. The resultant piece of artwork may also offer insight into the troubles experienced by the subject and may suggest suitable approaches to be used in more conventional forms of psychiatric therapy.
8.  _Art for propaganda, or commercialism._ Art is often utilized as a form of propaganda, and thus can be used to subtly influence popular conceptions or mood. In a similar way, art that tries to sell a product also influences mood and emotion. In both cases, the purpose of art here is to subtly manipulate the viewer into a particular emotional or psychological response toward a particular idea or object.<sup id="cite_ref-51" class="reference" style="line-height: 1; font-size: 11.1999998092651px; display: inline-block;">[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art#cite_note-51)</sup>
9.  _Art as a fitness indicator._ It has been argued that the ability of the human brain by far exceeds what was needed for survival in the ancestral environment. One [evolutionary psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_psychology "Evolutionary psychology") explanation for this is that the human brain and associated traits (such as artistic ability and creativity) are the human equivalent of the [peacock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacock "Peacock")'s tail. The purpose of the male peacock's extravagant tail has been argued to be to attract females (see also [Fisherian runaway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisherian_runaway "Fisherian runaway") and [handicap principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handicap_principle "Handicap principle")). According to this theory superior execution of art was evolutionary important because it attracted mates.<sup id="cite_ref-Dutton_52-0" class="reference" style="line-height: 1; font-size: 11.1999998092651px; display: inline-block;">[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art#cite_note-Dutton-52)</sup>

The functions of art described above are not mutually exclusive, as many of them may overlap. For example, art for the purpose of entertainment may also seek to sell a product, i.e. the movie or video game.

# Design Patterns

<div class="content" style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 22.3999996185303px;">

In software engineering, a <span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; font-weight: 700;">design pattern</span> is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. A design pattern isn't a finished design that can be transformed directly into code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.

### Uses of Design Patterns

Design patterns can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms. Effective software design requires considering issues that may not become visible until later in the implementation. Reusing design patterns helps to prevent subtle issues that can cause major problems and improves code readability for coders and architects familiar with the patterns.

Often, people only understand how to apply certain software design techniques to certain problems. These techniques are difficult to apply to a broader range of problems. Design patterns provide general solutions, documented in a format that doesn't require specifics tied to a particular problem.

In addition, patterns allow developers to communicate using well-known, well understood names for software interactions. Common design patterns can be improved over time, making them more robust than ad-hoc designs.

### [Creational design patterns](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/creational_patterns)

These design patterns are all about class instantiation. This pattern can be further divided into class-creation patterns and object-creational patterns. While class-creation patterns use inheritance effectively in the instantiation process, object-creation patterns use delegation effectively to get the job done.

<div class="ebook_ignore" style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; float: right; width: 225px;">[![Example of Abstract Factory](https://sourcemaking.com/files/v2/content/patterns/Abstract_Factory_example1.svg)](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/abstract_factory)</div>

    A class of which only a single instance can exist

### [Structural design patterns](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/structural_patterns)

These design patterns are all about Class and Object composition. Structural class-creation patterns use inheritance to compose interfaces. Structural object-patterns define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionality.

### [Behavioral design patterns](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/behavioral_patterns)

These design patterns are all about Class's objects communication. Behavioral patterns are those patterns that are most specifically concerned with communication between objects.

The architectural patterns address various issues in [software engineering](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering "Software engineering"), such as [computer hardware](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_hardware "Computer hardware")performance limitations, [high availability](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_availability "High availability") and minimization of a [business risk](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_risk "Business risk"). Some architectural patterns have been implemented within [software frameworks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework "Software framework").

### Steps to create a compiler
## Intro

A typical compiler does the following steps:

*   Parsing: the source text is converted to an abstract syntax tree (AST).
*   Resolution of references to other modules (C postpones this step till linking).
*   Semantic validation: weeding out syntactically correct statements that make no sense, e.g. unreachable code or duplicate declarations.
*   Equivalent transformations and high-level optimization: the AST is transformed to represent a more efficient computation with the same semantics. This includes e.g. early calculation of common subexpressions and constant expressions, eliminating excessive local assignments, etc.
*   Code generation: the AST is transformed into linear low-level code, with jumps, register allocation and the like. Some function calls can be inlined at this stage, some loops unrolled, etc.
*   Peephole optimization: the low-level code is scanned for simple local inefficiencies which are eliminated.

Most modern compilers (for instance, gcc and clang) repeat the last two steps once more. They use an intermediate low-level but platform-independent language for initial code generation. Then that language is converted into platform-specific code (x86, ARM, etc) doing roughly the same thing in a platform-optimized way. This includes e.g. the use of vector instructions when possible, instruction reordering to increase branch prediction efficiency, and so on.

After that, object code is ready for linking. Most native-code compilers know how to call a linker to produce an executable, but it's not a compilation step per se. In languages like Java and C# linking may be totally dynamic, done by the VM at load time.

## Remember the basics

*   Make it work
*   Make it beautiful
*   Make it efficient

This classic sequence applies to all software development, but bears repetition.

Concentrate on the first step of the sequence. Create the simplest thing that could possibly work.

## Read the books!

Read the [Dragon Book](http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0321486811) by Aho and Ullman. This is classic and is still quite applicable today.

[Modern Compiler Design](http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0471976970) is also praised.

If this stuff is too hard for you right now, read some intros on parsing first; usually parsing libraries include intros and examples.

Make sure you're comfortable working with graphs, especially trees. These things is the stuff programs are made of on the logical level.

## Define your language well

Use whatever notation you want, but make sure you have a complete and consistent description of your language. This includes both syntax and semantics.

It's high time to write snippets of code in your new language as test cases for the future compiler.

## Use your favorite language

It's totally OK to write a compiler in Python or Ruby or whatever language is easy for you. Use simple algorithms you understand well. The first version does not have to be fast, or efficient, or feature-complete. It only needs to be correct enough and easy to modify.

It's also OK to write different stages of a compiler in different languages, if needed.

### Prepare to write a lot of tests

Your entire language should be covered by test cases; effectively it will be _defined_ by them. Get well-acquainted with your preferred testing framework. Write tests from day one. Concentrate on 'positive' tests that accept correct code, as opposed to detection of incorrect code.

Run all the tests regularly. Fix broken tests before proceeding. It would be a shame to end up with an ill-defined language that cannot accept valid code.

## Create a good parser

[Parser generators are many](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_parser_generators). Pick whatever you want. You may also write your own parser from scratch, but it only worth it if syntax of your language is _dead_ simple.

The parser should detect and report syntax errors. Write a lot of test cases, both positive and negative; reuse the code you wrote while defining the language.

Output of your parser is an abstract syntax tree.

If your language has modules, the output of the parser may be the simplest representation of 'object code' you generate. There are plenty of simple ways to dump a tree to a file and to quickly load it back.

## Create a semantic validator

Most probably your language allows for syntactically correct constructions that may make no sense in certain contexts. An example is a duplicate declaration of the same variable or passing a parameter of a wrong type. The validator will detect such errors looking at the tree.

The validator will also resolve references to other modules written in your language, load these other modules and use in the validation process. For instance, this step will make sure that the number of parameters passed to a function from another module is correct.

Again, write and run a lot of test cases. Trivial cases are as indispensable at troubleshooting as smart and complex.

## Generate code

Use the simplest techniques you know. Often it's OK to directly translate a language construct (like an `if` statement) to a lightly-parametrized code template, not unlike an HTML template.

Again, ignore efficiency and concentrate on correctness.

### Target a platform-independent low-level VM

I suppose that you ignore low-level stuff unless you're keenly interested in hardware-specific details. These details are gory and complex.

Your options:

*   LLVM: allows for efficient machine code generation, usually for x86 and ARM.
*   CLR: targets .NET, mostly x86/Windows-based; has a good JIT.
*   JVM: targets Java world, quite multiplatform, has a good JIT.

## Ignore optimization

Optimization is hard. Almost always optimization is premature. Generate inefficient but correct code. Implement the whole language before you try to optimize the resulting code.

Of course, trivial optimizations are OK to introduce. But avoid any cunning, hairy stuff before your compiler is stable.

## So what?

If all this stuff is not too intimidating for you, please proceed! For a simple language, each of the steps may be simpler that you think.

Seeing a 'Hello world' from a program that your compiler created might be worth the effort.
