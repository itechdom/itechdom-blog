### The main models are
Technology and methodology[edit]Adaptive learning systems have traditionally been divided into separate components or 'models'. While different model groups have been presented, most systems include some or all of the following models (occasionally with different names):[5][6]Expert model - The model with the information which is to be taughtStudent model - The model which tracks and learns about the studentInstructional model - The model which actually conveys the information
### Relies on Baye's law for calculating probablities
### An incorrect answer will provide insight into what concepts the student is failing to understand
### if implemented in classroom environment, it's called intellegent tutoring systems
### Companies using Adaptive learning
Companies currently using adaptive learning technology[edit]A 2013 report commissioned by the Gates Foundation provides a list of almost forty companies currently active in adaptive learning technology.[13]ALEKS Corporation(McGraw-Hill Education),[14] an online assessment and learning company, uses the theory of knowledge spaces in its product (known as ALEKS[15]) to quickly and accurately determine what a student knows and doesn't know in a course.Carnegie Learning, a publisher of math curricula, offers adaptive math software (known as the Cognitive Tutor) to high school students, along with traditional textbook offerings.CCKF, developer of Realizeit, a content agnostic adaptive learning platform for educational institutions, publishers and professional associations.[16][17] Also provides a full API to connect to third-party products.[18]Cengage Learning, a publishing company whose Aplia product provides adaptive learning technology for Developmental English.DreamBox, an adaptive learning platform with individualized paths for personalized learning.eSpindle Learning, a nonprofit maintaining an online vocabulary and spelling coaching program based on the adaptive learning concept.GrockitKnewton, whose adaptive learning API connects to third-party products to help teachers identify and predict knowledge gaps and personalize content for each student[19]"through sophisticated, real-time analysis of reams of student performance data."[20]KnowRe, an engaging adaptive mathematics curriculum, provides granular assessments and an engaging and personalized learning environment.Desire2Learn, a provider of integrated learning platform, offers Knowillage LeaP[21] which creates personalized learning paths for any learner, using any repository of learning objectives, content, assessments and questions, which are automatically mapped.McGraw-Hill Education, a content, software and services-based education company. In 2013, the company acquired the ALEKS Corporation[22] and a 20 percent equity stake in Area9 Aps.[23]Pearson, an education company whose adaptive SuccessMaker software provides elementary and middle school reading and math instruction.PrepMe, an online learning company, currently uses adaptive learning technology for test preparation, K-12 education, and professional development.[24]Sherston Software, a UK education software company, offers PlanetSherston, an adaptive learning platform.Smart.fm, a social learning and community website, uses adaptive learning technology with the goal of increasing learning speed and retention.[25]Smart Sparrow, has an adaptive learning platform that offers instructional designers and teachers integrated tools to create, publish and analyse their own adaptive content.[26
### Game Design Implementation
Game Design Implementation[edit]In 2014, an educational researcher concluded a multi-year study of adaptive learning for educational game design. The research developed and validated the ALGAE (Adaptive Learning GAme dEsign) model, a comprehensive adaptive learning model based on game design theories and practices, instructional strategies, and adaptive models. The research extended previous researching in game design, instructional strategies, and adaptive learning, combining those three components into a single complex model.The study resulted in the development of an adaptive educational game design model to serve as a guide for game designers, instructional designers, and educators with the goal of increasing learning outcomes. Survey participants validated the value of the ALGAE model and provided specific insights on the model's construction, use, benefits, and challenges. The current ALGAE model is based on these insights. The model now serves as a guideline for the design and development of educational computer games.The model's applicability is assessed as being cross-industry including government and military agencies/units, game industry, and academia. The model's actual value and the appropriate implementation approach (focused or unfocused) will be fully realized as the ALGAE model's adoption becomes more widespread.[12]
