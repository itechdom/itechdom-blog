Adaptive learning systems have traditionally been divided into separate components or 'models'. While different model groups have been presented, most systems include some or all of the following models (occasionally with different names):[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_learning#cite_note-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_learning#cite_note-6)

*   Expert model - The model with the information which is to be taught
*   Student model - The model which tracks and learns about the student
*   Instructional model - The model which actually conveys the information
### Relies on Baye's law for calculating probablities
### An incorrect answer will provide insight into what concepts the student is failing to understand
### if implemented in classroom environment, it's called intellegent tutoring systems
### Companies using Adaptive learning

### Game Design Implementation
### Game Design Implementation[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Adaptive_learning&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Game Design Implementation")]

In 2014, an educational researcher concluded a multi-year study of adaptive learning for educational game design. The research developed and validated the ALGAE (Adaptive Learning GAme dEsign) model, a comprehensive adaptive learning model based on game design theories and practices, instructional strategies, and adaptive models. The research extended previous researching in game design, instructional strategies, and adaptive learning, combining those three components into a single complex model.

The study resulted in the development of an adaptive educational game design model to serve as a guide for game designers, instructional designers, and educators with the goal of increasing learning outcomes. Survey participants validated the value of the ALGAE model and provided specific insights on the model's construction, use, benefits, and challenges. The current ALGAE model is based on these insights. The model now serves as a guideline for the design and development of educational computer games.

The model's applicability is assessed as being cross-industry including government and military agencies/units, game industry, and academia. The model's actual value and the appropriate implementation approach (focused or unfocused) will be fully realized as the ALGAE model's adoption becomes more widespread.
