### How is interest charges calculated
**Where do interest charges come from?**  
Interest Charges are calculated in different ways. Your account statement describes the method that applies to you. In general, your balance for Interest Charges is based on one of these methods:

**Average Daily Balance:**   
The card company adds the amount you still owe from your previous statement (if you didn’t pay in full) to all new purchases and cash advances, and then divides the sum by the number of days in the billing cycle. It is shown on your statement each month you use the card.

**Adjusted Balance:**   
The card company takes your balance at the beginning of the Billing Cycle. It subtracts payments you make during the period. This means your balance is kept lower and you pay less in Interest Charges.

**Previous Balance:**   
This method applies the monthly Interest Charge to your beginning balance for the Billing Cycle. Purchases and payments during the month that follow aren’t included.

**Ending Balance:**   
The card company may use your ending balance for the Billing Cycle. If so, any purchases and payments during the Billing Cycle are included.
### Nice Example of interest charges
An Example: Discovering the Benefit of Increasing Your Payments  
Let\'s say John and Jane both have $2,000 debt on their credit cards, which require a minimum payment of 3%, or $10, whichever is higher. Both are strapped for cash, but Jane manages to pay an extra $10 on top of her minimum monthly payments. John pays only the minimum.

Each month John and Jane are charged a 20% annual interest on their cards\' outstanding balances. So, when John and Jane make payments, part of those payments go to paying interest and part go to the [principal](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/principal.asp).

Here is the breakdown of the numbers for the first month of John\'s credit card debt:

*   Principal: $2,000
*   Interest: $33.33 ($2,000 x (20%/12))
*   Payment: $60 (3% of remaining balance)
*   Principal Repayment (payment - interest): $26.67
*   Remaining Balance: $1,973.33 ($2,000 - $26.67)

These calculations are done every month until the credit card debt is paid off.

In the end, John pays $4,240 in total over 15 years to absolve the $2,000 in credit card debt. The interest that John pays over the 15 years totals $2,240, higher than the original credit card debt.

Because Jane paid an extra $10 a month, she pays a total $3,276 over seven years to absolve the $2,000 in credit card debt. Jane pays a total $1,276 in interest.

The extra $10 a month saves Jane almost $1,000 and cuts her repayment period by more than seven years!

The lesson here is that every little bit counts. Paying twice your minimum or more can drastically cut down the time it takes to pay off the balance, which leads to lower interest charges.  
However, as we will see below, it\'s wise not to pay only your minimum or even just a little more than your minimum. It\'s best simply not to carry a balance at all.

### Fees may be Associated
**Other costs of credit**  
There are other fees and expenses associated with using credit cards. The more you know about these costs, the better you can control your expenses.

**Annual fee:**   
This is the yearly cost of owning a credit card. Not all credit cards have an annual fee. This fee may be posted to your balance when you open the account and added each year on the anniversary of your account opening.

**Late fees: **  
These are charged when you fail to pay the minimum payment due by its due date. To be sure your payment arrives on time, mail it at least 5 to 7 days before it is due. Many credit card companies offer online payments through your checking account. This option is generally much faster than traditional mail and usually posts to your account within 24 hours.

**Other fees: **  
These include an over-the-limit fee if your balance exceeds your credit limit. You may also be charged fees for returned checks, cash advance checks or stop-payment requests.
