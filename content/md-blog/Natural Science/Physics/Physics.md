# Concepts
### The scientific method


*   Identify a problem  

*   Make an educated guess about the answer. This is called hypothesis.  

*   Perform experiments to test your hypothesis  

*   Formulate a general rule

### Electricity
### Electric force
### you have two forces acting on you
### Replling
### Atttracting
### you don't feel them because they balance each other out
### How to calculate
### Coulombs law
### F = K * |q1| * |q2| / d^2
### d is distance between two objects
### q quantity of charge
### k is called the proportionality constant or electrostatic constant.

### 9,000,000,000 N.m2/C2
### Interpreting the results
The sign just tells you how the particles will behave.

If the charges have the same sign, the force is repulsive.

If the charges have different signs, the force is attractive.

However, when doing the math, the values of the charges must be positive.



1 Coulomb is the charge of approximately 6.24 quintillion electrons.

or 6.24 billion billion electrons.

or 6.24 ×10 18

In other words, it is the charge that goes through a 100-watt light bulb in 1 second.


### Gravity law 
F = G 

m1m2d2



**Gravitational force**:

*   Product of masses
*   G is very small  

*   Only attractive
*   Inverse-square law  

**Electrical force**:

*   attractive or repulsive
*   K is very big
*   Product of charges
*   Inverse-square law
### Atoms contain
### Electron
### Nuclues
### Proton
### Neutron
### if it has more electrons
### it's negatively charged
### if it has more prutons
### it's positive
### Electron affinity
### doesn't lose electrons easily
### unlike human skin or silk
### when you rub your feet, you attract electric charge
### so when you touch a door, you get electrocuted due to the transfer of electrons
### Electrons
### Mobile electrons are good conductors
### because they move freely in the outer sphere of an atom
### the more electrons the better conductivity
### Induction
### Charging by induction
### http://www.introduction-to-physics.com/charging-by-induction.html
### if you have two spheres and a rod
### you can charge one sphere with negative and another with positive. 
### they become one conductor
### if you have one sphere and you touch it. You are grounded at that point. The electrons will transfer from your finger to the ground
### you are grounded
### Conductors
### good conductors
Some materials are naturally good conductors. Metals such as aluminum, gold, silver, platinum, copper, steel, and iron are good conductors just like they are good conductors of heat.
### Insulators
### bad conductors
However, in some materials, electrons are not as free to move around. Instead, they are tightly bound to atoms. There materials are poor conductors of electricity. We call these materials insulators.
### electrons are tightly bound, they are not free to move
### Example of bad conductors
Some examples of insulators are glass, rubber, and porcelain.
### they are used to prevent electricity from flowing outside
### Like a wire
### An insulator that surrounds a metal to prevent someone from getting hurt
### Semi conductors
### Silicon
### Germanium
### transistors are semi conductors
### Super conductors
In some materials, however, called superconductors, the resistance is equal to 0\. If a current is set up in a superconductor, electricity will continue to flow indefinitely or "forever" with no battery or other source of energy needed to maintain it.
### Electrostatic Force
### with a positive charge around an object
### there will be an electric field around the object
### similar to gravitational field
### Formula
### E = k |q| / d^2
### Direction of electric field
### Place  a positive charge near an electric field coming from a sphere that's negatively charged

### is a vector
### since it has direction
### Electric dipole
### Electric field lines for an electric dipole.

An **electric dipole** is a system made up of 2 charges with equal magnitude, but opposite sign.

### capacitor
Each plate has more than one of the same charge one on top of the other.

### http://www.introduction-to-physics.com/what-is-a-capacitor.html
### Definition
What is a capacitor? A capacitor is a common device used in electricity to store electrical energy.

This electrical energy can then be released later in many ways.



*   To power a light bulb.  

*   Create a flash when taking a photo with a digital camera.  

*   To power a specific device for a short time during a power outage.  


### Electric potential energy
### VS. potential energy
An object has potential energy as a result of its location. If you try to lift an object, the object is located in a force field and that force field is gravity. When the object is lifted to a certain height it has gravitational potential energy. If you compress a spring, it will also store potential energy. In both cases, this potential energy (PE) that the object has stored has the ability to do work when released.
### When you left an object it  has the potential to exert a certain energy when it's started, since it falls within a gravitational field
### Or a spring, the more you compress, the more energy an object will store
### When a charged object move towards a positive rod, it will store Electric PE 
### the closer, the more energy it will contain
### Electric current
### Flow of electric charge
### conduction electrons
### are electrons that move freely
### image of a current
In the images below, we show a flow of electric charge so things can be crystal clear in your mind. The red arrows shows the direction.

![](http://www.introduction-to-physics.com/images/direction-of-electric-current.png)
### inside a wire
![Flow of electric charge](http://www.introduction-to-physics.com/images/flow-of-electric-charge.png "Flow of electric charge")Flow of electric charge inside a wire
### Unit is ampere
### understanding it
1 ampere is the flow of 1 coulomb of charge every second.

You could also say 1 coulomb of charge per second.

1 ampere is the electric current in 100-watt light bult

1 coulomb is the electric charge of 6.24 billion billion electrons or   6.24 quintillion electrons.

That is a lot of electrons flowing inside a wire every second!
### Ohm's law
Ohm's law is a formula discovered by Ohm which helps us to measure the electric current in a circuit.

- See more at: http://www.introduction-to-physics.com/ohm-s-law.html#sthash.hoGnjCSc.dpuf
### formula to measure electric current 
### C = voltage / resistance
### 1 ampere 
### 1 voltage
### 1 resistance (ohm)
### Voltage source
### charges don't flow unless they are connected to a
### battery
### generator
### it's like an electric pump
### the higher the voltage, the more current will flow
In summary a voltage source is a device used to move electric current in a circuit. The higher the voltage, the more current will flow in the circuit. Home outlets can deliver 120 volts while a AA battery could deliver 1.5  volts.

![voltage symbols](http://www.introduction-to-physics.com/images/voltage-symbols.png "voltage symbols")
### DC
### direct current
### batteries
### AC
### Alternative current
### generator
### Electric resistance
### opposite of voltage
### it will prevent the flow of electricity
### Depends on
The electric resistance may depend on the following factors

*   The conductivity of the material 
*   The thickness of the material
*   The length of the material
*   The temperature
### Electric power
### voltage * current
### in watts
### example
Say for instance an iron is rated at 1200 watts. If you home outlet is 120 volts, the iron will draw a current of 10 amperes.

Why? It is because 1200  = 10 × 120
### another formula
###      Electric power definition #2  

Electric power = 

energytime



From the formula, you can see that the electric power is the rate at which energy is transferred. This second definition of electric power can also help us to calculate the cost of electric energy and we will show you how in a different lesson.

If 

102

 = 5, then 10 = 5 × 2

If electric power = 

energytime

   then, energy = electric power × time

energy = electric power × time is the formula to use to calculate the cost of electric energy.
### Circuits
### types
### series
### current doesn't have a choice of paths between a and b
### http://www.introduction-to-physics.com/series-circuit-rules.html
### parallel
### a current has a choice of paths
### http://www.introduction-to-physics.com/parallel-circuit-rules.html
### resistors
### constricts the flow of voltage
