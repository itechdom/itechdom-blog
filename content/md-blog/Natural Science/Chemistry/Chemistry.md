A [chemical reaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction "Chemical reaction") is a transformation of some substances into one or more different substances.[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry#cite_note-39) The basis of such a chemical transformation is the rearrangement of electrons in the chemical bonds between atoms. It can be symbolically depicted through a [chemical equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_equation "Chemical equation"), which usually involves atoms as subjects. The number of atoms on the left and the right in the equation for a chemical transformation is equal. (When the number of atoms on either side is unequal, the transformation is referred to as a [nuclear reaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_reaction "Nuclear reaction") or [radioactive decay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay "Radioactive decay").) The type of chemical reactions a substance may undergo and the energy changes that may accompany it are constrained by certain basic rules, known as chemical laws.
