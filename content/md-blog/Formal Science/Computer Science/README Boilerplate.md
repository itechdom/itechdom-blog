### Digital Standards Guide Boilerplate
A template of README best practices to make your README simple to understand and easy to use.  

### Installation

### Usage
## Javascript Organization

You can use the different modules under either **app/client/components** or **app/server/components**. Inside each component folder, for example **todo/**, you can see these file extensions:

* todo.js : That's the main file which will load all the other files.

* todo.view.js: Any view rendering is done here. This also includes modules on the server as well (any ```response.write( )``` ).

* todo.model.js: Any data storage and manipulation.

* todo.spec.js: test file.

* todo.scss: sass file to style todo only (See section below on Sass organization).
