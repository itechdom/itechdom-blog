# Concepts
### 4 main models
## Structure[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Intelligent_tutoring_system&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Structure")]

Intelligent tutoring systems consist of four basic components based on a general consensus amongst researchers (Nwana,1990;[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_tutoring_system#cite_note-Nwana-18) Freedman, 2000;[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_tutoring_system#cite_note-Freedman-19) Nkambou et al., 2010[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_tutoring_system#cite_note-Nkambou-20)):

1.  The Domain model
2.  The Student model
3.  The Tutoring model, and
4.  The User interface model

The _domain model_ (also known as the [cognitive model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_model "Cognitive model") or expert knowledge model) is built on [ACT-R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT-R "ACT-R") theory which tries to take into account all the possible steps required to solve a problem. More specifically, this model "contains the concepts, rules, and problem-solving strategies of the domain to be learned. It can fulfill several roles: as a source of expert knowledge, a standard for evaluating the student's performance or for detecting errors, etc." (Nkambou et al., 2010, p. 4).[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_tutoring_system#cite_note-Nkambou-20)

The _student model_ can be thought of as an overlay on the domain model. It is considered as the core component of an ITS paying special attention to student's cognitive and affective states and their evolution as the learning process advances. As the student works step-by-step through their problem solving process the system engages in a process called _model tracing_. Anytime the student model deviates from the domain model the system identifies, or _flags_, that an error has occurred.

The _tutor model_ accepts information from the domain and student models and makes choices about tutoring strategies and actions. At any point in the problem-solving process the learner may request guidance on what to do next, relative to their current location in the model. In addition, the system recognizes when the learner has deviated from the production rules of the model and provides timely feedback for the learner, resulting in a shorter period of time to reach proficiency with the targeted skills.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_tutoring_system#cite_note-21) The tutor model may contain several hundred production rules that can be said to exist in one of two states, _learned_ or _unlearned_. Every time a student successfully applies a rule to a problem, the system updates a probability estimate that the student has learned the rule. The system continues to drill students on exercises that require effective application of a rule until the probability that the rule has been learned reaches at least 95% probability.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_tutoring_system#cite_note-22)

_Knowledge tracing_ tracks the learner's progress from problem to problem and builds a profile of strengths and weaknesses relative to the production rules. The cognitive tutoring system developed by [John Anderson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Robert_Anderson_(psychologist) "John Robert Anderson (psychologist)") at Carnegie Mellon University presents information from knowledge tracing as a _skillometer_, a visual graph of the learner's success in each of the monitored skills related to solving algebra problems. When a learner requests a hint, or an error is flagged, the knowledge tracing data and the skillometer are updated in real-time.

The _user interface_ component "integrates three types of information that are needed in carrying out a dialogue: knowledge about patterns of interpretation (to understand a speaker) and action (to generate utterances) within dialogues; domain knowledge needed for communicating content; and knowledge needed for communicating intent" (Padayachee, 2002, p. 3).[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_tutoring_system#cite_note-Padayachee-23)

Nkambou et al. (2010) make mention of Nwana's (1990)[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_tutoring_system#cite_note-Nwana-18) review of different architectures underlining a strong link between architecture and paradigm (or philosophy). Nwana (1990) declares, "[I]t is almost a rarity to find two ITSs based on the same architecture [which] results from the experimental nature of the work in the area" (p. 258). He further explains that differing tutoring philosophies emphasize different components of the learning process (i.e., domain, student or tutor). The architectural design of an ITS reflects this emphasis, and this leads to a variety of architectures, none of which, individually, can support all tutoring strategies (Nwana, 1990, as cited in Nkambou et al., 2010). Moreover, ITS projects may vary according to the relative level of intelligence of the components. As an example, a project highlighting intelligence in the domain model may generate solutions to complex and novel problems so that students can always have new problems to work on, but it might only have simple methods for teaching those problems, while a system that concentrates on multiple or novel ways of teaching a particular topic might find a less sophisticated representation of that content sufficient.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_tutoring_system#cite_note-Freedman-19)
### Design and development methods
## Design and development methods[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Intelligent_tutoring_system&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Design and development methods")]

Apart from the discrepancy amongst ITS architectures each emphasizing different elements, the development of an ITS is much the same as any [instructional design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instructional_design "Instructional design") process. Corbett et al. (1997) summarized ITS design and development as consisting of four iterative stages: (1) needs assessment, (2) cognitive task analysis, (3) initial tutor implementation and (4) evaluation.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_tutoring_system#cite_note-Corbett_et_al-24)

The first stage known as needs assessment, is common to any instructional design process, especially software development. This involves a _learner analysis_, consultation with subject matter experts and/or the instructor(s). This first step is part of the development of the expert/knowledge and student domain. The goal is to specify learning goals and to outline a general plan for the curriculum; it is imperative not to computerize traditional concepts but develop a new curriculum structure by defining the task in general and understanding learners' possible behaviours dealing with the task and to a lesser degree the tutor's behavior. In doing so, three crucial dimensions need to be dealt with: (1) the probability a student is able to solve problems; (2) the time it takes to reach this performance level and (3) the probability the student will actively use this knowledge in the future. Another important aspect that requires analysis is cost effectiveness of the interface. Moreover, teachers and student entry characteristics such as prior knowledge must be assessed since both groups are going to be system users.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_tutoring_system#cite_note-Corbett_et_al-24)

The second stage, cognitive task analysis, is a detailed approach to expert systems programming with the goal of developing a valid computational model of the required problem solving knowledge. Chief methods for developing a domain model include: (1) interviewing domain experts, (2) conducting "think aloud" protocol studies with domain experts,(3) conducting "think aloud" studies with novices and (4) observation of teaching and learning behavior. Although the first method is most commonly used, experts are usually incapable of reporting cognitive components. The "think aloud" methods, in which the experts is asked to report aloud what s/he is thinking when solving typical problems, can avoid this problem.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_tutoring_system#cite_note-Corbett_et_al-24) Observation of actual online interactions between tutors and students provides information related to the processes used in problem-solving, which is useful for building dialogue or interactivity into tutoring systems.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_tutoring_system#cite_note-25)

The third stage, initial tutor implementation, involves setting up a problem solving environment to enable and support an authentic learning process. This stage is followed by a series of evaluation activities as the final stage which is again similar to any software development project.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_tutoring_system#cite_note-Corbett_et_al-24)

The fourth stage, evaluation includes (1) pilot studies to confirm basic usability and educational impact; (2) formative evaluations of the system under development, including (3) parametric studies that examine the effectiveness of system features and finally, (4) summative evaluations of the final tutor's effect: learning rate and asymptotic achievement levels.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_tutoring_system#cite_note-Corbett_et_al-24)

**Eight principles of ITS design and development**

Anderson et al. (1987)[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_tutoring_system#cite_note-26) outlined eight principles for intelligent tutor design and Corbett et al. (1997)[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_tutoring_system#cite_note-Corbett_et_al-24) later elaborated on those principles highlighting an all-embracing principle which they believed governed intelligent tutor design, they referred to this principle as:

Principle 0: An intelligent tutor system should enable the student to work to the successful conclusion of problem solving.

1.  Represent student competence as a production set.
2.  Communicate the goal structure underlying the problem solving.
3.  Provide instruction in the problem solving context.
4.  Promote an abstract understanding of the problem-solving knowledge.
5.  Minimize working memory load.
6.  Provide immediate feedback on errors.
7.  Adjust the grain size of instruction with learning.
8.  Facilitate successive approximations to the target skill.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_tutoring_system#cite_note-Corbett_et_al-24)
### Cognitive stage
### Interviewing domain experts
### Real life
## Use in practice[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Intelligent_tutoring_system&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Use in practice")]

All this is a substantial amount of work, even if [authoring tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoring_tool "Authoring tool") have become available to ease the task.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_tutoring_system#cite_note-27) This means that building an ITS is an option only in situations in which they, in spite of their relatively high development costs, still reduce the overall costs through reducing the need for human instructors or sufficiently boosting overall productivity. Such situations occur when large groups need to be tutored simultaneously or many replicated tutoring efforts are needed. Cases in point are technical training situations such as training of military recruits and high school mathematics. One specific type of intelligent tutoring system, the [Cognitive Tutor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_tutor "Cognitive tutor"), has been incorporated into mathematics curricula in a substantial number of United States high schools, producing improved student learning outcomes on final exams and standardized tests.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_tutoring_system#cite_note-28) Intelligent tutoring systems have been constructed to help students learn geography, circuits, medical diagnosis, computer programming, mathematics, physics, genetics, chemistry, etc. Intelligent Language Tutoring Systems (ILTS), e.g. this[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_tutoring_system#cite_note-29) one, teach natural language to first or second language learners. ILTS requires specialized natural language processing tools such as large dictionaries and morphological and grammatical analyzers with acceptable coverage.
### Applications
## Applications[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Intelligent_tutoring_system&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Applications")]

During the rapid expansion of the web boom, new computer-aided instruction paradigms, such as [e-learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-learning "E-learning") and distributed learning, provided an excellent platform for ITS ideas. Areas that have used ITS include [natural language processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing "Natural language processing"), [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning "Machine learning"), planning, [multi-agent systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-agent_systems "Multi-agent systems"), [ontologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontologies "Ontologies"), [semantic Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web "Semantic Web"), and social and emotional computing. In addition, other technologies such as multimedia, [object-oriented systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Object-oriented_systems&action=edit&redlink=1 "Object-oriented systems (page does not exist)"), modeling, simulation, and statistics have also been connected to or combined with ITS. Historically non-technological areas such as the educational sciences and psychology have also been influenced by the success of ITS.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_tutoring_system#cite_note-30)

In recent years, ITS has begun to move away from the search-based to include a range of practical applications.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_tutoring_system#cite_note-31) ITS have expanded across many critical and complex cognitive domains, and the results have been far reaching. ITS systems have cemented a place within formal education and these systems have found homes in the sphere of corporate training and organizational learning. ITS offers learners several affordances such as individualized learning, just in time feedback, and flexibility in time and space.

While Intelligent tutoring systems evolved from research in cognitive psychology and artificial intelligence, there are now many applications found in education and in organizations. Intelligent tutoring systems can be found in online environments or in a traditional classroom computer lab, and are used in K-12 classrooms as well as in universities. There are a number of programs that target mathematics but applications can be found in health sciences, language acquisition, and other areas of formalized learning.

Reports of improvement in student comprehension, engagement, attitude, motivation, and academic results have all contributed to the ongoing interest in the investment in and research of theses systems. The personalized nature of the intelligent tutoring systems affords educators the opportunity to create individualized programs. Within education there are a plethora of intelligent tutoring systems, an exhaustive list does not exist but several of the more influential programs are listed below.

### Examples in education[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Intelligent_tutoring_system&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Examples in education")]

_**Algebra Tutor**_ PAT (PUMP Algebra Tutor or Practical Algebra Tutor) developed by the Pittsburgh Advanced Cognitive Tutor Center at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Mellon_University "Carnegie Mellon University"), engages students in anchored learning problems and uses modern algebraic tools in order to engage students in problem solving and in sharing of their results. The aim of PAT is to tap into a students' prior knowledge and everyday experiences with mathematics in order to promote growth. The success of PAT is well documented (ex. Miami-Dade County Public Schools Office of Evaluation and Research) from both a statistical (student results) and emotional (student and instructor feedback) perspective.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_tutoring_system#cite_note-32)

_**Mathematics Tutor**_ The Mathematics Tutor (Beal, Beck & Woolf, 1998) helps students solve word problems using fractions, decimals and percentages. The tutor records the success rates while a student is working on problems while providing subsequent, lever-appropriate problems for the student to work on. The subsequent problems that are selected are based on student ability and a desirable time in is estimated in which the student is to solve the problem.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_tutoring_system#cite_note-33)

_**eTeacher**_ eTeacher (Schiaffino et al., 2008) is an intelligent agent or [pedagogical agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedagogical_agent "Pedagogical agent"), that supports personalized e-learning assistance. It builds student profiles while observing student performance in online courses. eTeacher then uses the information from the student's performance to suggest a personalized courses of action designed to assist their learning process.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_tutoring_system#cite_note-34)

_**ZOSMAT**_ ZOSMAT was designed to address all the needs of a real classroom. It follows and guides a student in different stages of their learning process. This is a student-centered ITS does this by recording the progress in a student's learning and the student program changes based on the student's effort. ZOSMAT can be used for either individual learning or in a real classroom environment alongside the guidance of a human tutor.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_tutoring_system#cite_note-35)

_**REALP**_ REALP was designed to help students enhance their reading comprehension by providing reader-specific lexical practice and offering personalized practice with useful, authentic reading materials gathered from the Web. The system automatically build a user model according to student's performance. After reading, the student is given a series of exercises based on the target vocabulary found in reading.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_tutoring_system#cite_note-36)

_**CIRCSlM-Tutor**_ CIRCSIM_Tutor is an intelligent tutoring system that is used with first year medical students at the Illinois Institute of Technology. It uses natural dialogue based, Socratic language to help students learn about regulating blood pressure.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_tutoring_system#cite_note-37)

_**Why2-Atlas**_ Why2-Atlas is an ITS that analyses students explanations of physics principles. The students input their work in paragraph form and the program converts their words into a proof by making assumptions of student beliefs that are based on their explanations. In doing this, misconceptions and incomplete explanations are highlighted. The system then addresses these issues through a dialogue with the student and asks the student to correct their essay. A number of iterations may take place before the process is complete.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_tutoring_system#cite_note-38)

_**SmartTutor**_ The University of Hong Kong (HKU) developed a SmartTutor to support the needs of continuing education students. Personalized learning was identified as a key need within adult education at HKU and SmartTutor aims to fill that need. SmartTutor provides support for students by combining Internet technology, educational research and artificial intelligence.[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_tutoring_system#cite_note-39)

_**AutoTutor**_ [AutoTutor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoTutor "AutoTutor") assists college students in learning about computer hardware, operating systems and the Internet in an introductory computer literacy course by simulating the discourse patterns and pedagogical strategies of a human tutor. AutoTutor attempts to understand learner's input from the keyboard and then formulate dialog moves with feedback, prompts, correction and hints.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_tutoring_system#cite_note-40)

_**ActiveMath**_ ActiveMath is a web-based, adaptive learning environment for mathematics. This system strives for improving long-distance learning, for complementing traditional classroom teaching, and for supporting individual and lifelong learning.[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_tutoring_system#cite_note-41)

_**ESC101-ITS**_ The Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, India developed the ESC101-ITS, an intelligent tutoring system for introductory programming problems.

### Examples in corporate training and industry[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Intelligent_tutoring_system&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Examples in corporate training and industry")]

_**SHERLOCK**_ "SHERLOCK" is used to train Air Force technicians to diagnose problems in the electrical systems of F-15 jets. The ITS creates faulty schematic diagrams of systems for the trainee to locate and diagnose. The ITS provides diagnostic readings allowing the trainee to decide whether the fault lies in the circuit being tested or if it lies elsewhere in the system. Feedback and guidance are provided by the system and help is available if requested.[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_tutoring_system#cite_note-42)

_**Cardiac Tutor**_ The Cardiac Tutor's aim is to support advanced cardiac support techniques to medical personnel. The tutor presents cardiac problems and, using a variety of steps, students must select various interventions. Cardiac Tutor provides clues, verbal advice, and feedback in order to personalize and optimize the learning. Each simulation, regardless of whether the students were successfully able to help their patients, results in a detailed report which students then review.[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_tutoring_system#cite_note-43)

_**CODES**_ Cooperative Music Prototype Design is a Web-based environment for cooperative music prototyping. It was designed to support users, especially those who are not specialists in music, in creating musical pieces in a prototyping manner. The musical examples (prototypes) can be repeatedly tested, played and modified. One of the main aspects of CODES is interaction and cooperation between the music creators and their partners.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_tutoring_system#cite_note-44)
### How effective is it?
## Effectiveness[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Intelligent_tutoring_system&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Effectiveness")]

Assessing the effectiveness of ITS programs is problematic. ITS vary greatly in design, implementation, and educational focus. When ITS are used in a classroom, the system is not only used by students, but by teachers as well. This usage can create barriers to effective evaluation for a number of reasons; most notably due to teacher intervention in student learning. Teachers often have the capability to enter new problems into the system, adjusting the curriculum and creating interactions with the students as they learn. All of these variables make evaluation of an ITS complex.[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_tutoring_system#cite_note-45)

Despite the inherent complexities, numerous studies have attempted to measure the overall effectiveness of ITS, often by comparisons of ITS to human tutors.[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_tutoring_system#cite_note-Anderson_et_al-46)[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_tutoring_system#cite_note-Christmann_.26_Badgett-47)[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_tutoring_system#cite_note-Fletcher-48)[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_tutoring_system#cite_note-VanLehn-49) Reviews of early ITS systems (1995) showed an effect size of _d_ = 1.0 in comparison to no tutoring, where as human tutors were given an effect size of _d_ = 2.0.[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_tutoring_system#cite_note-Anderson_et_al-46) Kurt VanLehn's much more recent overview (2011) of modern ITS found that there was no statistical difference in effect size between expert one-on-one human tutors and step-based ITS.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_tutoring_system#cite_note-VanLehn-49) Some individual ITS have been evaluated more positively than others. Studies of the Algebra Cognitive Tutor found that the ITS students outperformed students taught by a classroom teacher on standardized test problems and real-world problem solving tasks.[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_tutoring_system#cite_note-Koedinger_et_al-50) Subsequent studies found that these results were particularly pronounced in students from special education, non-native English, and low-income backgrounds.[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_tutoring_system#cite_note-Plano-51)

Some recognized strengths of ITS are their ability to provide immediate yes/no feedback, individual task selection, on-demand hints, and support mastery learning.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_tutoring_system#cite_note-VanLehn-49)[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_tutoring_system#cite_note-Koedinger_.26_Vincent-52)
