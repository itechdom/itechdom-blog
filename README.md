# iTechdom Blog
Sharing what I learn about almost everything.

##Installation
Run **gulp** to compile the JavaScript files. Checkout **app/** to see how modules are being loaded. I am using RxJS extensively in this application. The purpose of App is to run whatever module you load under **app/client/main.js** or **app/server/main.js**

## Why?
I have an obsession with Mindmaps. I have always learned through them. This is why I created this repo. It contains all the mindmaps that I use while I am learning new concepts.

## Content
Under **content/** you can find the blog in different formats (md, json). Also, under **presnetations/** you can find Reveal.js "ready" slides.

## Upcoming Features
Many Examples here involve a lot of setup to run the actual code. That's why I am going to use docker scripts here to install all the required components and handle running all the applications.
