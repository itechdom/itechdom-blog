# iTechdom Blog
We talk Programming and Startups.

# Content
Under **content/** you can find the blog in different formats (md, json, mindmup). Also, under presnetations you can find Reveal.js "ready" slides.

## Upcoming Features
Many Examples here involve a lot of setup to run the actual code. That's why I am going to use docker scripts here to install all the required components and handle running all the applications.
