# iTechdom Blog
Sharing what I learn about almost everything.

## Why?
I have an obsession with Mindmaps. I have always learned through them. This is why I created this repo. It contains all the mindmaps that I use while I am learning new concepts.

## Content
Under **content/** you can find the blog in different formats (md, json, mindmup). Also, under presnetations you can find Reveal.js "ready" slides.

## Upcoming Features
Many Examples here involve a lot of setup to run the actual code. That's why I am going to use docker scripts here to install all the required components and handle running all the applications.
