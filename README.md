Sharing what I learn about almost everything.

## Branching system
Due to the overwhelming number of repos that I start just to experiment with a new framework, I split up this repo into branches. Each branch contains a        language/framework/project that I am experimenting with. This helps me separate the build process from code which makes it very easy to branch off master and   install the appropiate packages and get coding.

## Installation
* `git checkout any-branch` to use a specific branch.
* Go to README to learn more about the project.

## Upcoming Features
* Docker:
Many Examples here involve a lot of setup to run the actual code. That's why I am going to use docker scripts here to install all the required components and   handle running all the applications.
