                        <p class="col-md-8"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Landdox had pain points in a &nbsp;page in which they needed users to upload information and display it on the same page. They requested I work with the current design within a small timeframe and not make major changes to the design. I like a good challenge, as they say constraint can bring creativity. I had to problem solve within the confines of their
                            requirements.</span></p>

                        <div class="col-md-8">
                            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My first step was to speak with the stakeholders about their users. As time was limited and I did not have access to the users to do testing, I gathered as much information as I could from the stakeholders. Users&nbsp;expressed frustration with the page where they upload documents (leases and tracks) and fill out forms based on the documents.&nbsp;</span><span
                                style="font-weight: 400;">Users were unable to navigate the page easily.&nbsp;</span></p>
                            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To solve the problem I used background colors to differentiate the part of the page where people needed to fill in information and upload documents and the part of the page where information is displayed. I also placed ‘call to action’ buttons in intuitive places within the page and highlighted areas so the user would know what information is mandatory. I used tabs in the forms area
                                so users could click between leases and tracks.</span></p>
